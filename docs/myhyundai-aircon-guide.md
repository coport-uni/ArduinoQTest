# MyHyundai Aircon — Home Assistant Custom Component Guide

Remote climate control for a Korean Hyundai vehicle from Home
Assistant, implemented per
[SPEC-myhyundai-aircon-component.md](SPEC-myhyundai-aircon-component.md).

> **Read this first.** This is an *unofficial* automation. It works
> by tapping the MyHyundai (마이현대, `com.hyundai.oneapp.kr`) home
> screen widget on a dedicated Android phone over ADB — because no
> official control API exists for the Korean region. A MyHyundai app
> update can break it at any time. Review your account's terms of
> service yourself, and keep this strictly personal-use: every
> deployment runs on the owner's own phone and account.

Verified end-to-end on 2026-09-01: a real Casper Electric received
aircon ON in ~32 s and OFF in ~10 s from `switch.myhyundai_aircon`,
with results judged from the app's push notifications.

## 1. How it works

```
Home Assistant (custom component)
  │  adb-shell over TCP :5555, RSA key auth
  ▼
Dedicated Android phone (Galaxy Z Fold3, cover screen)
  │  wake → HOME → tap the MyHyundai widget button
  ▼
MyHyundai app → Bluelink server → vehicle
  │
  ▼
Result push notification ("원격제어 결과 안내")
  ← polled via `dumpsys notification --noredact` and judged
```

The switch is **assumed-state** (`assumed_state: true`): the
component cannot read the real climate state, so ON reflects the
last judged success and auto-reverts after the vehicle-side maximum
runtime (10 min by default).

The tap sequences are **data, not code**: they live in
`custom_components/myhyundai_aircon/recipes/default.json`. When the
app UI changes, edit the JSON and call the
`myhyundai_aircon.reload_recipe` service — no Python changes, no
restart.

## 2. Phone preparation (spec §12)

Settings on the dedicated phone. Items marked **required** were
proven necessary on real hardware; the rest reduce flakiness.

| Area | Setting | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Developer options | USB debugging (USB 디버깅) | On | **Required.** Also accept the RSA prompt ("항상 허용") |
| Developer options | Stay awake while charging (충전 중 화면 켜짐 유지) | On | recommended |
| Developer options | Animation scales ×3 (애니메이션 배율) | 0.5x | recommended |
| Screen | Screen timeout (화면 자동 꺼짐) | Maximum | the component wakes the screen itself |
| Screen | **Lock screen (잠금 화면)** | **None (없음)** | **Required.** A PIN/pattern blocks automation cold — verified during bring-up |
| Screen | Rotation | Portrait, locked | |
| Foldable | Fold state | Folded, cover screen | the widget renders fine on the cover screen (verified) |
| Launcher | MyHyundai widget | On the **default** home page | HOME must land on it (verified: page 1 of 2, default) |
| Battery | MyHyundai battery optimization | Excluded | keeps pushes prompt |
| Battery | Charge limit | 85 % if supported | phone lives on the charger |
| Network | Phone IP | DHCP reservation | this rig: 192.168.31.113 |
| System / apps | Auto-updates (system and MyHyundai) | Off | an app update can change the UI |

**ADB over TCP**: adbd needs `adb tcpip 5555` once per phone boot,
and nothing on the phone re-issues it. On this rig the phone hangs
off the UNO Q's USB hub, so the board re-arms TCP itself --
`adb-tcp-rearm.timer` (in `apps/adb-tcp-rearm/`) probes the port
every two minutes and acts only when it is shut (see §7). Keep the
phone on the charger anyway: a reboot still costs up to two minutes
of ADB downtime.

## 3. Installation (this rig: HA Core venv on the UNO Q)

The board runs HA Core 2026.2.3 in a venv
(`home-assistant.service`, config at `/home/arduino/ha_config`).
Deploy from the repo checkout:

```bash
scp -r custom_components/myhyundai_aircon \
  unoq:/home/arduino/ha_config/custom_components/
ssh unoq 'sudo systemctl restart home-assistant'
```

HA installs the pinned `adb-shell[async]==0.4.4` (the same version
HA core's androidtv integration pins — do not change one without
the other) automatically on first load.

For a HACS-based install instead, add this repository as a custom
repository of type "Integration" (`hacs.json` is present).

## 4. Configuration

Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → **MyHyundai
Aircon**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Device IP address | the phone's reserved IP (e.g. 192.168.31.113) |
| ADB TCP port | 5555 |
| ADB key path | empty to auto-generate under `.storage/` — the phone will then show one RSA prompt to accept. Point it at an already-authorized key (e.g. `/home/arduino/.android/adbkey`) to skip the prompt |
| Entity name prefix | `myhyundai` |

The flow proves the connection, uses the phone serial as the unique
ID, and stores the effective screen resolution automatically
(Override size preferred — screenshots and UI dumps use it; on the
Z Fold3 cover screen that is 840x2289, not the physical 832x2268).

**Options** (gear icon on the integration) expose the spec §5.2
tuning: cooldown (default 60 s — do **not** lower it; it protects
the vehicle's 12 V battery from rapid repeat commands), minimum
command gap, vehicle battery sensor + floor, auto-off minutes,
sequence timeout, retries, screen check, dump-on-failure. The
notification wait limit is set per-step in the recipe instead.

## 5. Entities and services

| Entity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `switch.myhyundai_aircon` | Aircon ON/OFF (optimistic; auto-OFF after `aircon_max_minutes`). Attributes: `last_result`, `last_error_code`, `last_started`, `expires_at`, `screen_checked` |
| `sensor.myhyundai_last_result` | `success` / `failure` / `unknown` |
| `sensor.myhyundai_last_error` | last spec §9.3 error code or `none` |
| `sensor.myhyundai_last_notification` | last judged notification text |
| `binary_sensor.myhyundai_device_connected` | ADB reachability (30 s poll, 5/15/45/60 s reconnect backoff) |
| `sensor.myhyundai_vehicle_battery` | EV battery %, scraped read-only from the widget |
| `sensor.myhyundai_vehicle_range` | Driving range (km), scraped from the widget |
| `binary_sensor.myhyundai_doors_locked` | 문잠김/문열림 from the widget status text; unknown until observed |
| `sensor.myhyundai_data_updated_at` | The widget's "N시 기준" timestamp (Korean 오전/오후 parsed; day rolls back when needed — requires the HA timezone to be set correctly) |
| `sensor.myhyundai_app_version` | MyHyundai versionName from `dumpsys package` — automate an alert on change to catch UI-breaking updates early |
| `binary_sensor.myhyundai_climate_running` | REAL climate state: while remote climate runs the widget draws a blue aura around the car image, detected by pixel analysis of the poll screenshot (calibrated 2026-09-02: ON = 0.015 glow fraction, OFF = exactly 0; threshold 0.005; raw value exposed as the `glow_fraction` attribute). Updates on every vehicle poll, and within ~30 s after each switch command. Unlike the assumed-state switch, this notices when the car shuts climate off by itself |

The vehicle sensors come from a **read-only widget scrape** (wake →
home → UI dump → parse) every `vehicle_poll_minutes` (default 15,
0 disables), serialized behind the sequence lock and never sending
a vehicle command. A failed scrape keeps the previous values.

**Force-refresh** (`widget_refresh_enabled`, default off): when on,
each poll first taps the widget's refresh control so the data is
freshly fetched before scraping. This DOES reach the vehicle's
telematics and, done frequently, can drain the 12 V battery — only
enable it if you accept that (recommend a poll interval of a few
minutes at least). Climate glow is measured from the settled widget
*before* the refresh tap, because the refresh itself lights the
same blue aura for ~30 s (the aura marks active remote
communication, not climate alone — a live finding); the fresh data
is read *after* the refresh.

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `myhyundai_aircon.capture_dump` | Save the phone's UI hierarchy XML + screenshot PNG to `config/myhyundai_aircon_dumps/` (retention: 40 files). The tool for recipe work and debugging |
| `myhyundai_aircon.run_sequence` | Run any recipe sequence through the same guards/retries as the switch; `ignore_guards: true` bypasses the guards |
| `myhyundai_aircon.reload_recipe` | Re-read the recipe JSON without restarting HA |

Every run fires a `myhyundai_aircon_result` event (`sequence`,
`result`, `code`, `elapsed_sec`, `attempt`, `screen_checked`,
`notification_text`) for automations.

Note: because of the cooldown guard, turning the switch OFF within
60 s of turning it ON is rejected with `E_COOLDOWN` — wait, or call
`run_sequence` with `ignore_guards: true` if you must.

## 6. Error codes (spec §9.3)

| Code | Meaning | Retried? |
|---|---|---|
| `E_RECIPE_INCOMPLETE` | placeholders / empty steps in the sequence | no |
| `E_MIN_GAP` / `E_COOLDOWN` | guard rejection (too soon) | no |
| `E_BATTERY_LOW` | vehicle battery sensor under the floor | no |
| `E_DEVICE_OFFLINE` | ADB unreachable | via coordinator backoff |
| `E_SCREEN_MISMATCH` | resolution differs from baseline — phone probably unfolded | no |
| `E_SESSION_EXPIRED` | login screen detected (needs `login_markers`, see §8) | no |
| `E_UNKNOWN_SCREEN` | expected UI node not found | no (dump saved) |
| `E_TIMEOUT` | no result notification in time | yes — force-stops the app first |
| `E_VEHICLE_FAIL` | failure notification received | yes — after `retry_gap_sec` |

With `dump_on_failure` on (default), every failed attempt saves an
XML+PNG pair named `fail-<sequence>-<attempt>`.

## 7. This rig's specifics (UNO Q)

- Phone: Galaxy Z Fold3 (SM-F926N, Android 15), serial
  R3CR80H1GBN, on the board's USB hub for power + one-time ADB
  bootstrap, WiFi IP 192.168.31.113.
- A standalone adb client lives at `/home/arduino/adb-local/`
  (extracted from .debs — Debian's adb package conflicts with the
  board's preinstalled Arduino android libraries). The binary is
  `/home/arduino/adb-local/rootfs/usr/bin/adb` and it only runs with
  its own libraries on the path:
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/arduino/adb-local/rootfs/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/android`.
  The `arduino` user is in `plugdev` for USB access.
- After a phone reboot, TCP mode is gone and must be re-armed over
  the USB connection with `adb tcpip 5555`. This is automated by
  `apps/adb-tcp-rearm/`, installed as:

  ```bash
  cd apps/adb-tcp-rearm
  sudo install -m 755 adb-tcp-rearm.sh /usr/local/bin/
  sudo install -m 644 adb-tcp-rearm.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable --now adb-tcp-rearm.timer
  ```

  The script probes TCP 5555 and re-arms only when it is shut, so
  the happy path is a single TCP connect. Override `PHONE_SERIAL`,
  `PHONE_HOST` or `ADB_PORT` in the unit if the rig changes.
- What the missing re-arm actually breaks: a phone reboot alone is
  survivable, but if HA restarts while TCP is down the config entry
  lands in `setup_retry` and every `myhyundai_*` entity turns
  `unavailable`. `away-car-aircon.yaml` then fails **silently** --
  its condition on `switch.myhyundai_aircon == 'off'` can never be
  true, so it neither fires nor logs. Verified on 2026-09-09 after
  five days of dead automation.
- The component's config entry reuses the already-authorized
  `/home/arduino/.android/adbkey`, so no extra phone prompts.

## 8. Recipe maintenance

`recipes/default.json` currently encodes (all values read from the
real device, never guessed):

- `aircon_on` / `aircon_off`: wake → HOME → wait for the launcher →
  wait for + tap the widget button matched by
  `content_desc: "공조 켜기" / "공조 끄기"` (the widget exposes no
  resource-ids) → await the result notification
  (`공조가 켜졌습니다` / `공조가 꺼졌습니다`, 60 s). No confirm
  popup exists.
- Two values are still unobserved and can be filled later by
  editing the JSON only:
  - **Failure texts (U6)**: when a run ever fails for real (doors
    open, 96-hour window expired…), read the exact text from
    `sensor.myhyundai_last_notification` or a `capture_dump`, add
    it to `failure_contains`, and `reload_recipe`. Until then a
    failure judges as `E_TIMEOUT` and retries.
  - **Login markers (U8)**: if the app ever logs out, run
    `capture_dump` on the login screen and put a distinctive
    string into `login_markers` so runs fail fast with
    `E_SESSION_EXPIRED` instead of timing out.
- Widget button reference (from the 2026-09-01 dump):
  `공조 켜기`, `공조 끄기`, `문 잠금`, `충전 시작` — door lock and
  charging sequences can be added the same way.

## 9. Operational caveats (spec §15)

1. Hyundai remote control only works within **96 hours of the last
   ignition-off**; after that expect `E_VEHICLE_FAIL`/`E_TIMEOUT`.
2. Remote climate runs at most **10 minutes** vehicle-side; the
   auto-off default matches.
3. Keep the 60 s cooldown — repeated remote commands stress the
   vehicle's 12 V battery.
4. Unofficial automation: app updates can break it (that is what
   `capture_dump` + the recipe JSON are for), and account terms are
   the owner's responsibility.
5. Personal use only.
