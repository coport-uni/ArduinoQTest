## 2026-07-27 — ha-mcu-bridge on uno-q (matrix load bars) + reboot persistence

Requested by user: reproduce the original rig's LED-matrix CPU/MEM load
bars on the new board (uno-q), and make HA and the MCU sketch survive a
board reboot. GitHub issue #12.

- [x] Deploy apps/ha-mcu-bridge over SSH (scp + CRLF strip on the
      board), first build compiled zephyr + flashed the STM32U585 via
      on-board OpenOCD; python container logs "MQTT connected: Success"
- [x] Verify bridge: unoq/bridge/availability online + 6 retained LED
      state topics on the broker; 6 switch.uno_q_mcu_* entities in HA;
      toggle_test.sh on switch.uno_q_mcu_uno_q_led3_g -> 6/6 OK
- [x] Verify matrix path: 0 "stats push failed" log lines; 15 s 4-core
      `yes` stress raised load avg to 1.08 (bar growth is visual —
      user can confirm on the board)
- [x] Reboot persistence config: all three containers
      restart=unless-stopped; docker + arduino-app-cli services
      enabled; ha-mcu-bridge registered as default app
- [x] Reboot test: board rebooted via privileged helper (`systemctl
      reboot` over SSH is denied). SSH back in ~60 s; all three
      containers auto-started within seconds; HA answered 200; Z2M
      bridge republished {"state":"online"}; ha-mcu-bridge auto-started
      as default app (availability "online"). Post-reboot toggle on
      switch.uno_q_mcu_uno_q_led3_g: 6/6 OK. Exactly 3 "stats push
      failed" lines during boot (router not up yet) then 0 — same
      recovery pattern as the SungwooQ rig. Tapo + Z2M entities all
      live (dormtapo2 reading 1.4 W).

## 2026-07-27 — HA + Sonoff Dongle Max + Zigbee2MQTT on new network (BLOCKED)

Requested by user. Board reported at 192.168.31.172 (new 192.168.31.x
network; previous rig lived on 192.168.1.x), login arduino/arduino.
Plan: install HA per docs/home-assistant-uno-q-guide.md, verify the
Sonoff Zigbee Dongle Max over USB, run Zigbee2MQTT (docker container —
HA Container has no add-on store), verify via network checks, and
research popular community dashboard designs.

- [x] Diagnose SSH connectivity: 192.168.31.172 answers ping
      (ARP 14:b5:cd:eb:1f:c9 = Liteon wifi module, consistent with the
      UNO Q) but EVERY probed TCP port (22, 8123, 8080, 1883, 5555 …)
      is actively refused, and a full /24 sweep found no host with
      port 22 open. Conclusion: the board is on WiFi but sshd is not
      running — the guide §10 "fresh image: sshd has no host keys"
      symptom. No adb device on USB, so remote recovery is impossible.
- [ ] BLOCKED: re-run guide step 2a over USB (host-key generation +
      ssh.service start), then steps 3-6 (HA install + onboarding +
      long-lived token)
- [ ] BLOCKED: verify Sonoff Dongle Max enumeration (lsusb,
      /dev/serial/by-id) and Zigbee2MQTT container (adapter: ember)
      + MQTT integration + network-level verification
- [x] Research popular dashboard designs — see
      docs/ha-dashboard-research.md (Dwains / UI Lovelace Minimalist /
      Mushroom / Bubble Card / theme table + HA-Container HACS notes)
- [x] Restore the CommonClaude submodule checkout (was empty; ruleset
      and hooks now present) and file GitHub issue #11 for this session

### Results (2026-07-27, after the user attached the board over USB)

- SSH root cause confirmed on the NEW board (hostname uno-q, adb serial
  2369462340 — a different unit from SungwooQ): ssh.service inactive
  AND disabled, zero host keys in /etc/ssh. Fixed via the guide 2a
  privileged docker helper extended with `systemctl enable ssh`;
  public key installed over adb; `ssh unoq hostname` -> uno-q with no
  password. All later work ran over WiFi/SSH only (user unplugged USB
  to attach a hub).
- Gotcha (new): scripts scp'd from this Windows checkout carry CRLF
  and bash rejects them (`set: pipefail: invalid option name`); every
  script needed `sed -i 's/\r$//'` on the board before running.
- HA Container 2026.7.3 installed per guide step 3; scripted
  onboarding (owner arduino) + 10-year token minted (steps 4/6).
- Disk pressure: HA pull left / at 100 % (36 MB free). With the
  user's explicit approval (AskUserQuestion) removed unused preloaded
  images ei-models-runner:0.5.0 (1.31 GB) + influxdb:2.7 (393 MB) ->
  1.8 GB free (82 %). python-apps-base kept for App Lab apps.
- Sonoff Dongle Max verified: lsusb shows CP210x (10c4:ea60) behind
  the user's USB hub; /dev/serial/by-id names it
  "SONOFF_SONOFF_Dongle_Max_MG24_..." -> /dev/ttyUSB0.
- Zigbee2MQTT 2.12.1 (koenkk/zigbee2mqtt, host network, by-id device
  passthrough, adapter: ember) talks to the dongle: coordinator
  EmberZNet 7.4.5. Verified bridge online on MQTT, permit_join
  request->response {"status":"ok"} round-trip, HA MQTT integration
  registered (create_entry, loaded), bridge entities live in HA, and
  frontend HTTP 200 from the host PC over LAN (:8080). Note: a mid-
  session dongle unplug killed the container and docker did not
  auto-restart it (device node missing) — `docker start zigbee2mqtt`
  after replugging.
- Tapo re-verified on this network/account: DormTapo1 192.168.31.19
  (18:69:45:71:0C:49) and DormTapo2 192.168.31.240 (18:69:45:71:05:EC)
  both KLAP-authenticated via python-kasa, registered in HA
  (create_entry each). toggle_test.sh switch.dormtapo2 at 5 s:
  10/10 transitions OK; plug restored to ON; live power readout
  2.2 W / 218.7 V / 0.02 A confirms energy monitoring.
- Dashboard recommendation #1 applied without HACS (OAuth is
  interactive): mushroom.js v5.1.1 + bubble-card.js (dist) downloaded
  into /config/www/community/, catppuccin.yaml v2.1.3 into
  /config/themes/, resources + "Mushroom" storage dashboard
  (url mushroom-home) written into .storage with HA stopped, default
  theme set to Catppuccin Mocha (dark). Verified: both JS URLs and
  /mushroom-home return HTTP 200. HACS can be layered on later for
  updates.

## 2026-07-13 — WiFi via ADB, Home Assistant on UNO Q, Tapo P110M detection

Requested by user. Target board: Arduino UNO Q "SungwooQ" (Debian 13,
aarch64), reached over ADB (serial 2018875248).

Workflow deviations: this repository has no git remote and no commits yet,
so the GitHub issue / working branch / PR steps of CLAUDE.md §4 cannot be
performed. They will apply once the repo gains a remote.

- [x] Verify board WiFi connectivity via ADB (already on TP-Link_0624,
      192.168.1.232; confirm internet and DNS)
- [x] Install Home Assistant on the board with Docker
      (ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable, host networking for
      device discovery)
- [x] Complete HA onboarding via REST API and obtain an access token
- [x] Verify HA detects two TP-Link Tapo P110M plugs (tplink discovery
      flows), cross-checked with a python-kasa network discovery scan
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-07-13)

- Board WiFi: already connected to TP-Link_0624 (user-confirmed SSID and
  password), IP 192.168.1.232, internet OK. USB permission for ADB was
  fixed by chmod on /dev/bus/usb/003/021 via a privileged docker helper
  (host user lacks passwordless sudo; resets on board replug).
- Home Assistant 2026.7.2 running in container `homeassistant` on the
  board (image ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable, host network,
  /home/arduino/homeassistant as /config, restart=unless-stopped).
- Onboarding completed via API; owner user `arduino`. Access token stored
  on the board at /home/arduino/.ha_token (not in this repo).
- Detection verified: HA tplink config-flow discovery listed BOTH plugs:
  `052F P110M (192.168.1.239) 18:69:45:71:05:2f` and
  `027C P110M (192.168.1.79) 18:69:45:71:02:7c`. Cross-checked with a
  python-kasa unicast sweep of 192.168.1.0/24 (claude_test/probe_all.py).
- Note: the second plug (052F) only appeared on the network partway
  through the session; earlier full-subnet sweeps found just one device.
- Not done: adding the plugs as config entries — KLAP auth requires the
  user's TP-Link (Tapo) account credentials. Discovery/detection does not.
- Verification scripts preserved in claude_test/ (see its README).

## 2026-07-13 — Reproducibility guide for other UNO Q boards

Requested by user: write a guide so the WiFi + Home Assistant + Tapo
verification procedure can be repeated on any Arduino UNO Q.

- [x] Generalize claude_test scripts (probe_all.py takes a subnet prefix
      argument; ha_onboard.sh takes HA_USER/HA_PASS/HA_BASE/HA_TOKEN_FILE
      env vars instead of hardcoded values)
- [x] Write docs/home-assistant-uno-q-guide.md covering ADB setup and the
      USB permission fix (udev rule or docker chmod workaround), WiFi via
      nmcli over adb, HA container install, scripted onboarding, two-level
      Tapo P110M detection verification, and troubleshooting
- [x] Update claude_test/README.md for the parameterized scripts

## 2026-07-13 — WiFi + VS Code Remote-SSH development for UNO Q

Requested by user: develop the UNO Q over WiFi from VS Code, with the
whole board (Linux MPU + STM32 MCU) programmable without a USB cable.
Chosen workflow: VS Code Remote-SSH directly onto the board, verified all
the way to flashing a sample app over WiFi.

Workflow deviations: the repository still has no git remote, so the
GitHub issue / PR steps of CLAUDE.md §4 cannot be performed (same
deviation as the entries above).

- [x] Enable SSH on the board (root cause: sshd had no host keys;
      generate via privileged docker helper and start ssh.service)
- [x] Set up passwordless SSH from the dev container (ed25519 key +
      `sungwooq` alias in ~/.ssh/config; container-global
      /etc/ssh/ssh_config `Port 6800` overridden with explicit Port 22)
- [x] Check board memory headroom for vscode-server alongside the
      Home Assistant container
- [x] Create sample app ~/ArduinoApps/qtest_blink (LED blink sketch on
      the STM32 + Python heartbeat on Linux) and build/flash it purely
      over WiFi with arduino-app-cli
- [x] Round-trip check: change the blink period, re-flash over WiFi,
      user confirms the LED speed change visually (pending user's
      visual confirmation; both flashes reported success)
- [x] Write docs/uno-q-vscode-wifi-guide.md; copy the sample app to
      claude_test/qtest_blink/ and update claude_test/README.md

### Results (2026-07-13)

- sshd failed with "no hostkeys available"; fixed with a one-shot
  privileged helper (`docker run --privileged --pid=host
  python:3.12-alpine nsenter -t 1 ... ssh-keygen -A`) since the board
  sudo needs a password. Service is enabled and now active.
- Passwordless SSH works: `ssh sungwooq hostname` -> SungwooQ. Client
  gotcha found: this container sets `Port 6800` globally in
  /etc/ssh/ssh_config, so the host entry pins `Port 22`.
- Board is the 4 GB variant (3.6 GiB visible, ~2.4 GiB available with
  Home Assistant running) — plenty for vscode-server.
- qtest_blink built, flashed to the STM32U585 (on-board OpenOCD over
  SWD bitbang) and started purely over WiFi in ~98 s; Python heartbeat
  visible via `arduino-app-cli app logs`. Blink period then changed
  500 ms -> 100 ms and re-flashed over WiFi (`app restart`), app
  reported running.
- CLI quirk: `arduino-app-cli app ps` panics ("not implemented") in
  v0.6.6; `app list` works.
- Guide: docs/uno-q-vscode-wifi-guide.md (incl. VS Code Remote-SSH
  setup and ProxyJump variant); app copy in claude_test/qtest_blink/.

## 2026-07-13 — Register both Tapo plugs in HA and run toggle test

Requested by user: complete the tplink integration for both detected
P110M plugs and physically toggle plug "052F" on/off at 3-second
intervals as an end-to-end test.

- [x] Obtain working Tapo account credentials from user (first attempt
      failed KLAP auth; verified correct ones with python-kasa before
      retrying the HA flow). Credentials are NOT stored in this repo;
      HA keeps them in its own config store on the board.
- [x] Replace expired onboarding token with a 10-year long-lived token
      (claude_test/ha_login.sh + mint_ll.py; stored at ~/.ha_token on
      the board)
- [x] Register both plugs via config flow (claude_test/ha_add_tapo.sh):
      entry "tapo_p1 P110M" = 052F / 192.168.1.239,
      entry "tapo_p2 P110M" = 027C / 192.168.1.79. Full entity sets
      created incl. energy sensors (tapo_p2 measured 7.3 W live load).
- [x] Toggle test on switch.tapo_p1 (user-selected 052F): 3 cycles of
      on/off at 3 s intervals, state verified after every command —
      6/6 transitions OK, initial state (off) restored
      (claude_test/toggle_test.sh)

## 2026-07-13 — Extend the UNO Q guide with integration & control steps

Requested by user: consolidate all work done so far into
docs/home-assistant-uno-q-guide.md.

- [x] Add step 6 (long-lived token via ha_login.sh + mint_ll.py),
      step 7 (plug registration with KLAP credential pre-check via
      python-kasa, ha_add_tapo.sh, entity listing), and step 8
      (3-second toggle test with load-safety caution)
- [x] Extend troubleshooting (invalid_auth case-sensitivity, stale
      flows, Tapo-app name vs physical label mismatch) and the file map

## 2026-07-13 — Control the on-board MCU (STM32U585) from Home Assistant

Requested by user; plan approved in plan mode. Architecture:
HA <-> MQTT (Mosquitto) <-> App Lab app python <-> arduino-router Bridge
RPC <-> MCU sketch. Same deviation as above: no git remote, so no GitHub
issue/branch/PR.

- [x] Write App Lab app `apps/ha-mcu-bridge/` (sketch provides
      set_pin_by_name RPC; python runs paho-mqtt with HA MQTT Discovery,
      6 RGB LED channels enabled by default, D2-D13 opt-in; ruff passed)
- [x] Start Mosquitto broker on the board (eclipse-mosquitto:2 container,
      host network, loopback-only listener; conf in apps/mosquitto/)
- [x] Register MQTT integration in HA via config flow
      (claude_test/ha_add_mqtt.sh; entry "127.0.0.1" loaded)
- [x] Stop the other session's qtest_blink app before re-flashing the
      MCU (one sketch at a time; restore with
      `arduino-app-cli app start ~/ArduinoApps/qtest_blink`)
- [x] Build/flash/start ha-mcu-bridge on the board (gotcha found: adb
      shell sets Android-style TMPDIR=/data/local/tmp which does not
      exist on Debian -> build fails with "Stat /Data/Local/Tmp";
      fix is TMPDIR=/tmp). Second gotcha: App Lab python runs in a
      bridged container, so the broker needed a second listener on
      172.17.0.1 (docker0) and the app connects there, not loopback.
      Sketch flashed via on-board OpenOCD (SWD); python container
      "ha-mcu-bridge-main-1" logs "MQTT connected: Success".
- [x] Verify end-to-end: availability "online" + 6 discovery configs +
      6 retained OFF states on the broker; HA auto-created 6 entities
      (switch.uno_q_mcu_uno_q_led3_r ... led4_b); toggle test on
      switch.uno_q_mcu_uno_q_led3_g: 3 cycles at 3 s -> 6/6 OK,
      ~1 s command-to-state latency, LED3 blinking green physically.
- [x] Update docs/home-assistant-uno-q-guide.md (new section 9,
      troubleshooting rows, file map) and claude_test/README.md
      (ha_add_mqtt.sh row)

## 2026-07-13 — README for R4-experienced newcomers; first content push

Requested by user: summarize all work in README.md (audience: knows the
UNO R4, never touched a UNO Q), then commit and push. User directed a
direct commit+push to main, so the branch/PR steps of CLAUDE.md §4/§12
are skipped for this bootstrap push by explicit instruction.

- [x] Write README.md: R4-vs-Q mental-model table (dual-brain, ADB
      instead of serial upload, on-board compile/flash, app = sketch +
      python pair), architecture diagram, verified results, repo
      layout, quick start, hardware gotchas
- [x] Add .gitignore (Python + App Lab build artifacts + secrets,
      incl. .ha_token)
- [x] Commit all project content and push to origin/main

## 2026-07-14 — Switch the HA workflow from ADB to WiFi/SSH

Requested by user: the board's USB port must stay free for expansion
devices (e.g. a Zigbee dongle), so Home Assistant on the UNO Q should
be managed over WiFi/SSH per docs/uno-q-vscode-wifi-guide.md, with ADB
reduced to the one-time bootstrap. Verification: toggle switch.tapo_p1
on/off for 3 cycles at 3-second intervals over SSH. (see LP §2, §5)

- [x] Rework docs/home-assistant-uno-q-guide.md: ssh/scp as the primary
      transport, ADB folded into a one-time bootstrap section that
      references the WiFi guide (see LP §2, §5)
- [x] Update README.md (intro, quick start, gotchas, repo layout) to
      the SSH-first workflow
- [x] Update claude_test/README.md re-run instructions to ssh, fix the
      ha_onboard.sh header comment, rename mint_ll.py token client name
- [x] Verify over SSH: run claude_test/toggle_test.sh on switch.tapo_p1
      for 3 cycles at 3 s intervals with state checks after each command
- [x] Post-test history check found tapo_p1 had a ~90 W load (89.4 W in
      the first ON window) despite the off-state 0.0 W pre-check; guide
      step 8 CAUTION extended to warn that off-state 0 W hides a load

### Results (2026-07-14)

- Guide restructured: step 1 = one-time ADB bootstrap (USB perms +
  WiFi), step 2 = SSH enablement pointing at the WiFi guide; steps 3-9
  keep their numbers, so existing cross-references stay valid. All
  `adb push`/`adb shell` commands became `scp`/`ssh unoq`. The
  `TMPDIR=/tmp` requirement is now documented as adb-only fallback.
- mint_ll.py: token client_name adb-cli -> unoq-cli; file also brought
  Ruff-clean (import splitting, no semicolons) per the lint hook.
- Verification over SSH only (USB not involved): tapo_p1 pre-checked at
  0.0 W load, then `ssh sungwooq 'bash -s -- switch.tapo_p1 3'
  < claude_test/toggle_test.sh` -> 6/6 transitions OK at 3 s cadence,
  final state off restored. GitHub issue #1, branch
  docs/wifi-ssh-workflow.

## 2026-07-14 — System-load bars on the UNO Q LED matrix

Requested by user; plan approved in plan mode. Show Linux-side CPU%
and memory% on the on-board 8x13 LED matrix as horizontal bars (CPU on
2 rows, one blank row, MEM on 3 rows). Extends apps/ha-mcu-bridge
(user choice: the MCU runs one sketch at a time, and the HA MQTT
switches must keep working). Patterns taken from the board-bundled
examples system-resources-logger (psutil sampling) and
weather-forecast / air-quality-monitoring (matrixBegin/matrixWrite +
Bridge RPC). (see LP §3, §5)

- [x] Determine the raw matrixWrite bit order by decoding the official
      example frames (claude_test decoder script + README row)
- [x] Sketch: extern matrixBegin/matrixWrite, layout constants,
      setPixel/barCols helpers, show_load RPC handler, clear on setup
- [x] Python: psutil==7.0.0 dep, stats_loop daemon thread pushing
      Bridge.call("show_load", cpu, mem) every 2 s under bridge_lock
- [x] Deploy over SSH (scp + app restart, reflashes MCU) and verify:
      logs clean, idle bars visible, 4x yes stress grows the CPU bar,
      HA switch regression via toggle_test.sh (see LP §3)
- [x] Update docs (guide §9 + new §9e, README, app.yaml description)
      and LearnedPatterns (firmware matrix symbols + bit layout)

### Results (2026-07-14)

- Bit order settled WITHOUT hardware trial: decoding the official
  air-quality "good" icon under both candidate orders
  (claude_test/decode_matrix_frame.py) renders a clean smiley only
  for LSB-first — pixel i = row*13+col -> word[i/32] bit i%32. The
  planned corner-pixel hardware gate became unnecessary.
- Deploy gotcha: `app restart` reused the cached venv and python
  crashed with ModuleNotFoundError on psutil; fixed by `app stop`,
  `rm -rf .cache/.venv`, `app start` (now in guide troubleshooting
  and LearnedPatterns §3).
- Verified over SSH + user's eyes: 0 "stats push failed" in logs;
  idle bars (CPU 1-2 cols, MEM ~5 cols at ~35 %); 4-core `yes`
  stress (load avg 1.9 -> 3.0) grew and shrank the CPU bar;
  toggle_test.sh on switch.uno_q_mcu_uno_q_led3_g passed 6/6
  concurrently; user visually confirmed the layout. GitHub issue #3,
  branch feature/matrix-sysload.

## 2026-07-14 — Auto-start ha-mcu-bridge on boot

Requested by user after a board reboot left the app stopped (HA and
Mosquitto auto-restart via Docker policies, but App Lab apps do not
auto-start). Included in the feature/matrix-sysload branch / PR #4 at
the user's request. (see LP §1, §3)

- [x] Find the supported mechanism: arduino-app-cli daemon starts the
      "default app" at boot (`properties set default <app_path>`);
      no systemd/cron hack needed
- [x] Register /home/arduino/ArduinoApps/ha-mcu-bridge as default app
      on the board and confirm with `properties get default`
- [x] Verify end-to-end: reboot the board, confirm the app container
      comes up without manual start, MCU entities available, matrix
      bars updating
- [x] Document in guide step 9c + troubleshooting row; LearnedPatterns
      entry

### Results (2026-07-14)

- `arduino-app-cli properties set default <app_path>` is the supported
  autostart mechanism (the arduino-app-cli.service daemon starts the
  default app at boot); `systemctl reboot` over SSH is denied
  ("Interactive authentication required") so the reboot used the
  privileged docker helper (LP §1).
- Reboot verification (user-approved reboot): board back in ~45 s,
  HA + Mosquitto up ~1 min, ha-mcu-bridge-main-1 auto-started ~90 s
  after reboot with NO manual start; switch.uno_q_mcu_uno_q_led3_g
  available, matrix bars updating. Exactly 3 "stats push failed"
  lines during boot (router not up yet) then 0 — the per-iteration
  try/except recovered as designed. GitHub issue #5.

## 2026-07-14 — Make the README Quick start self-sufficient

Requested by user. The Quick start's step 1 mentioned "enable SSH +
install your key (guide steps 1-2)" only in a comment and then jumped
straight to `ssh unoq` — impossible on a fresh board (sshd ships
without host keys, no authorized key, no `unoq` alias; see LP §2).
Steps 4-5 likewise pointed at guide sections without commands. Goal:
following the Quick start ALONE on a brand-new UNO Q must reproduce
every verified feature (WiFi+SSH bootstrap, HA, long-lived token,
Tapo registration, MQTT broker + integration, ha-mcu-bridge app with
HA LED switches + matrix load bars, end-to-end toggle checks).

Workflow note: stacked on feature/matrix-sysload because PR #4 is
still open and the Quick start being fixed documents the matrix
feature; branch docs/quickstart-complete targets feature/matrix-sysload
instead of main.

- [x] Rewrite README Quick start to be fully executable end-to-end:
      adb udev fallback, sshd host-key generation + public-key install
      + `unoq` ssh alias (guide step 2, see LP §2), Tapo MAC discovery
      (probe_all.py) + per-MAC registration (ha_add_tapo.sh),
      Mosquitto + MQTT integration + app deploy + boot default app,
      switch-entity listing, and both toggle verifications
- [x] GitHub issue, branch docs/quickstart-complete, PR onto
      feature/matrix-sysload

### Results (2026-07-14)

- Quick start rewritten as seven fully executable steps (USB
  bootstrap incl. udev fallback -> SSH enablement/key/alias -> HA ->
  onboarding+token -> Tapo discovery+registration -> broker + MQTT
  integration + app deploy + boot default -> entity listing + both
  toggle tests), with the off-state-0 W plug caution. All commands
  taken verbatim from guide steps verified on hardware 2026-07-13/14;
  referenced claude_test/ scripts and paths cross-checked. GitHub
  issue #6, branch docs/quickstart-complete, PR #7 (stacked on PR #4
  because the Quick start documents the matrix feature).

## 2026-07-14 — Refactor ha-mcu-bridge main.py into HaMcuBridge class

Requested by user after a visual code review of
apps/ha-mcu-bridge/python/main.py. The user approved the review plan
in chat and asked to gather everything under one class ("god class"):
separate the public surface from internal helpers and fix the
MIT-convention findings from the review. Behavior must not change.

- [x] Wrap all behavior in a HaMcuBridge class: run() as the only
      public method; _handle_connect/_handle_message as paho-mqtt
      callbacks; _build_command_topic/_build_state_topic/_apply_pin/
      _publish_discovery/_push_stats_forever as internal helpers
- [x] Absorb module globals (client, bridge_lock) into instance state
- [x] Add the five missing docstrings; rename noun-shaped functions
      to verbs (MIT convention)
- [x] Promote the hardcoded 5 s reconnect delay to RETRY_DELAY_S
- [x] Fix the two 80-column violations (ruff format, line-length 80)
- [x] Add main() + __main__ guard after confirming the App Lab
      runtime executes main.py as a script, not an import
- [x] Verify on the board: deploy, app restart (see LP §3 venv note),
      "MQTT connected" in logs, HA switch toggle, matrix bars
- [x] GitHub issue, branch refactor/bridge-god-class, PR

### Results (2026-07-14)

- HaMcuBridge class in place: run() is the only public method;
  _handle_connect/_handle_message are the paho-mqtt callbacks; five
  underscore helpers; client and bridge_lock absorbed into __init__.
  The main() + __main__ guard is safe because the App Lab run.sh
  execs `python /app/python/main.py` (verified inside the container).
- The repo had no pyproject.toml, so the CommonClaude post-write ruff
  hook checked at Ruff's 88-column default and rejected 80-column
  wrapping; added a root pyproject.toml with line-length = 80 and a
  LearnedPatterns §3 entry.
- On-board verification (SungwooQ): scp + `app restart`; log shows
  "MQTT connected: Success"; availability topic "online"; LED3_G
  ON/OFF over MQTT echoed on the state topic with matching log lines;
  0 "stats push failed" over 3 min. GitHub issue #9, branch
  refactor/bridge-god-class, PR #10.

## 2026-08-25 — Cryptojacking incident on the ComfyUI Docker host

Requested by user: investigate why both GPUs were pinned at 100 %, then
record the incident on GitHub. Read-only forensic investigation only —
the user performed the containment (container + port removal) themselves.
Malicious ComfyUI custom node `champdev-comfyui-nodes` (unauthenticated
web terminal + file manager + telemetry beacon) installed via the exposed
ComfyUI-Manager API on 2026-08-23 was the entry point; it relaunched an
XMRig-style miner as root after the user's container reboot.

- [x] Identify the GPU consumer: host nvidia-smi showed both Quadro
      RTX 6000 at 100 % / ~250 W with no compute process listed;
      traced to a hidden `python` process inside the `comfyui`
      container (cmdline wiped, /proc/<pid>/exe unreadable even as
      root), outbound C2 to 166.117.41.217:9000 (AWS Global
      Accelerator front)
- [x] Find the entry vector: `champdev-comfyui-nodes` in the
      comfyui-data volume, installed 2026-08-23 03:38 (2 min before the
      miner started). Source review confirmed unauthenticated routes
      `/champdev/terminal/ws` (spawns a full PTY shell) and
      `/champdev/fm/*` (arbitrary file read/write/delete), plus a
      telemetry beacon to comfy-nodes-telemetry.champdev.in
- [x] Confirm re-infection after the user's reboot: ComfyUI log showed
      the champdev terminal reconnecting at 12:17 today; miner PID 759
      relaunched as root, GPUs back to 100 % — proving the volume-
      resident node re-loads on every start
- [x] Verify containment: after the user removed the container and
      port mapping, GPUs returned to idle (0-1 % / 12-35 W), no C2
      connection, comfyui container gone
- [x] Host + lateral-movement sweep (2026-08-23 onward): no host C2
      connection, no rogue accounts / admin changes, clean Run keys /
      scheduled tasks / startup folders, no suspicious new executables
      (only Defender/Plex/VSCode auto-updates), other containers
      (privileged sungwoo dind, webdav) clean. Infection stayed inside
      the deleted comfyui container
- [x] Record the incident as a GitHub issue via `gh` — GitHub issue #13
      (created after the user re-authenticated; `security` label absent
      in the repo, filed without a label)
- [ ] Remaining remediation (not yet executed): remove
      `champdev-comfyui-nodes` from the comfyui-data volume before any
      ComfyUI recreation; keep 8188 / ComfyUI-Manager off the public
      network (VPN or authenticated reverse proxy)

## 2026-09-01 — New board IP + Android phone detection on the UNO Q

Requested by user. Diagnosis this session: the board no longer answers
at 192.168.31.172; a subnet scan found it at 192.168.31.84 (hostname
SungwooQ, SSH key auth OK, up 11 days). Task: point the `unoq` SSH
alias at the new IP, then check whether the Android phone attached to
the board's USB port is recognized (lsusb / adb on the board).
(see LP §2, §5)

- [x] Update ~/.ssh/config `unoq` host entry to 192.168.31.84 and
      verify `ssh unoq` works (also removed a duplicate `unoq` block)
- [x] Enumerate USB devices on the board (lsusb) and identify the
      Android phone — NOT enumerated (see results)
- [x] Check adb-level recognition of the phone from the board — adb is
      not installed on the board; moot while nothing enumerates
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-01)

- `ssh unoq` -> SungwooQ at 192.168.31.84 (DHCP moved it from .172;
  ARP MAC 14:b5:cd:eb:00:b5). Config had the `unoq` block twice with
  the stale IP; collapsed to one entry. Suggest a DHCP reservation on
  the router to stop future drift.
- Android phone: NOT recognized. Current lsusb shows only the user's
  hub chain (Terminus hub, Genesys hubs, microSD reader, RTL8153
  ethernet, a USB-C Video Adaptor billboard device) — no phone-class
  device (no MTP/ADB/vendor 18d1/04e8-style entry).
- Kernel log shows something WAS cycling on hub ports 1-1.3.2/1-1.3.3
  up to ~40 min before the check (board 23:08 UTC): repeated
  enumerate/disconnect every few seconds as a cdc_acm serial device
  (ttyACM0), one "device descriptor read/64, error -71" — the classic
  bad-cable / insufficient-power signature. Silent since; port empty.
- udev's ID_VENDOR=Arduino / ID_MODEL=Imola record is the board's own
  DMI identity (UNO Q internal name), not a USB gadget — red herring.
- Next steps for the user: use a known-good DATA cable (charge-only
  cables reproduce exactly this), plug the phone directly into the
  board or a powered hub port, and set the phone's USB mode to File
  transfer / enable USB debugging. Then re-run lsusb; install adb on
  the board (`apt install adb`) only once the phone enumerates.

## 2026-09-01 — myhyundai_aircon custom component, stage 0

Requested by user; plan confirmed in chat against
docs/SPEC-myhyundai-aircon-component.md. Decisions: develop and test
on the UNO Q board itself; component source lives in this repo under
a new root `custom_components/` directory and is deployed to the
board's HA config over scp; the dedicated phone (Galaxy Z Fold3)
stays attached to the board USB permanently (charging + ADB TCP
bootstrap host). Before any change, preserve the current on-board
sources in a backup folder. Implementation follows spec §11 in four
PRs (skeleton+adb_client / dump+recipe engine / notification+
entities+guards / docs), with a mandatory stop before spec stages
5-6 until real-device dumps confirm U3-U8. Note: the phone does not
currently enumerate on the board USB (see previous entry), so
phone-side steps wait on the user replacing the cable; code stages
1-4 need no phone. (see LP §2, §3, §5)

- [x] Back up current on-board sources (/home/arduino/ArduinoApps,
      HA config /home/arduino/homeassistant) into a dated folder
      under /home/arduino/backup/ before touching anything
      (actual paths differ — see results)
- [x] Identify the adb-shell version pinned by the installed HA
      container and record it for manifest.json — adb-shell[async]
      ==0.4.4 (venv install, not container; see results)
- [x] Set up an on-board test venv (pytest + ruff +
      pytest-homeassistant-custom-component) for board-side testing
- [x] BLOCKED on user cable fix: enumerate the Z Fold3 on board USB,
      install adb, run `adb tcpip 5555`, record the phone's WiFi IP
      — done after the user enabled USB debugging; phone WiFi IP
      192.168.31.113 (needs DHCP reservation)
- [ ] BLOCKED on user: U2 gate — MyHyundai app runs normally with
      USB debugging enabled (project stops if not) — STRONG POSITIVE
      partial: widget renders live vehicle data with debugging on;
      full gate needs one real remote command (user)
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-01)

- Backup: /home/arduino/backup/2026-09-01-pre-myhyundai/ holds
  ArduinoApps.tar.gz (210 entries), ha_config.tar.gz (45),
  mosquitto.tar.gz (4), home-scripts.tar.gz (5); all four verified
  with `tar tzf`. Disk unchanged at 80 % used, 2.0 GB free.
- Environment surprise: this board (SungwooQ, 192.168.31.84) does
  NOT run HA Container. HA Core 2026.2.3 runs in a Python 3.13.5
  venv at /home/arduino/ha_venv as systemd `home-assistant.service`,
  config /home/arduino/ha_config, port 8123 answering HTTP 200.
  ArduinoApps holds only led3_ctl (running) and qtest_blank — no
  ha-mcu-bridge; the container stack described in earlier entries
  lives on the other unit (uno-q, ex-.172). Component deploy target
  is therefore /home/arduino/ha_config/custom_components/ and deps
  install into ha_venv (LP §5 entry added).
- adb-shell pin: HA 2026.2.3 androidtv manifest requires
  `adb-shell[async]==0.4.4` -> goes into our manifest.json verbatim.
- Test venv: /home/arduino/ha_test_venv (746 MB) with
  pytest-homeassistant-custom-component 0.13.316 (the release whose
  requires_dist pins homeassistant==2026.2.3, found via PyPI JSON —
  LP §3 entry added), pytest 9.0.0, ruff 0.16.5,
  adb-shell[async] 0.4.4. Imports verified on the board.
- Phone/U2 items remain blocked on the user replacing the USB data
  cable (phone did not enumerate; see the previous entry's results).
- GitHub issue #15, branch feature/myhyundai-aircon-stage0.
- Update (same day, user asked for a USB re-check): the phone now
  enumerates STABLY as 04e8:6860 SAMSUNG_Android (MTP mode) on hub
  port 1-1.3.2 after ~9 flapping cycles (devices 62-70) settled at
  device 71. Interfaces exposed: MTP (06), CDC ACM serial (02/0a ->
  ttyACM0), vendor ff/40 — NO adb interface (ff/42), i.e. USB
  debugging is OFF on the phone. Board-side adb client installed
  WITHOUT touching system packages: Debian's adb conflicts with the
  preinstalled Arduino android-libcutils (…arduino3/7 builds, used
  by the board's own adbd), and the privileged-helper route was
  denied, so adb 34.0.5-debian + stock android libs were extracted
  from .debs into /home/arduino/adb-local/rootfs (run with
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=…/rootfs/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/android).
  `adb version` OK; `adb devices` empty as expected. Next user
  action: enable Developer options > USB debugging on the Z Fold3
  and accept the RSA prompt; then re-run adb devices and
  `adb tcpip 5555`.
- Update 2 (same day, user enabled USB debugging): full ADB chain
  verified end-to-end. Fixes on the way: `arduino` added to the
  plugdev group (adb reported "no permissions"); `sg plugdev` strips
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH (setgid secure-execution), so it must be exported
  inside the sg command string. Phone authorized: SM-F926N
  (Z Fold3, Android 15), serial R3CR80H1GBN, cover screen
  `wm size` Physical 832x2268 with Override 840x2289 — screencap
  returns 840x2289, so the executor must prefer the override size
  for coordinate math. WiFi IP 192.168.31.113/24 (DHCP reservation
  still recommended). `adb tcpip 5555` + `adb connect
  192.168.31.113:5555` + TCP shell all OK — the exact transport the
  HA component will use. `com.hyundai.oneapp.kr` is installed.
  Bonus screenshot over TCP captured the HOME SCREEN WIDGET on the
  cover display: "캐스퍼 Electric", refreshed 08:23, 98 % / 386 km,
  four buttons labeled 켜기 / 잠금 / 시작 / 종료 — U9 (cover-screen
  rendering) answered YES, and the widget button layout for the
  aircon_on recipe is now known (text labels exist for tap_node
  matching). U2 is a strong partial positive (live vehicle data
  loads with debugging on); the full gate still needs one real
  remote command observed by the user. Screenshot kept off-repo
  (board ~/u2test.png) — car/account privacy.

## 2026-09-01 — myhyundai_aircon PR 1: skeleton + adb_client +
## config flow (spec §11 stages 1-2)

Requested by user ("머지 후 해줘" after PR #16 merged). First code
PR of the confirmed 4-PR plan: component skeleton under root
custom_components/myhyundai_aircon/, async ADB client on
adb-shell[async]==0.4.4 (the HA 2026.2.3 pin), and the Config Flow
that validates the connection and auto-saves the screen resolution
(preferring the Override size per stage-0 finding). Options flow is
deferred to the guards PR where its values are consumed. Unit tests
run on the board in /home/arduino/ha_test_venv; live verification =
deploy to /home/arduino/ha_config/custom_components/, restart HA,
drive the config flow over the REST API against the phone at
192.168.31.113:5555 reusing the already-authorized
/home/arduino/.android/adbkey. (see LP §3, §5)

- [x] Verify adb-shell 0.4.4 async API signatures against the
      installed package on the board before coding (§7 rule)
- [x] Skeleton: manifest.json (requirements pin), const.py,
      __init__.py (setup/unload with coordinator), coordinator.py
      (connectivity poll + backoff), strings.json, translations
      en/ko
- [x] adb_client.py: keygen-if-missing, connect with RSA signer,
      shell, close, error mapping (cannot_connect / auth_rejected /
      invalid_device), serial + wm-size probes
- [x] config_flow.py: user step, unique_id = device serial,
      baseline_screen auto-save (Override preferred)
- [x] Unit tests (tests/ + conftest) green in ha_test_venv on the
      board; ruff clean at line-length 80 — 12 passed in 2.53 s
- [x] Deploy to the board, restart home-assistant.service, create
      the config entry via REST config-flow API, confirm
      baseline_screen 840x2289 stored and entry loaded — done after
      the user approved a password reset (see results update)
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-01, PR 1)

- adb-shell 0.4.4 API confirmed from the installed source:
  AdbDeviceTcpAsync(host, port, default_transport_timeout_s),
  connect(rsa_keys=[signer], auth_timeout_s), shell(cmd,
  read_timeout_s, timeout_s), close(), keygen(path),
  PythonRSASigner.FromRSAKeyPath(path), and the exception set used
  for error mapping.
- Component skeleton written under root custom_components/
  myhyundai_aircon/ (manifest pins adb-shell[async]==0.4.4,
  version 0.1.0). Coordinator polls connectivity every 30 s and
  walks the 5/15/45/60 s backoff ladder while disconnected.
  parse_screen_size prefers the Override resolution (stage-0
  finding: screencaps use 840x2289, not the physical 832x2268).
- Tests: tests/{conftest,test_adb_client,test_config_flow}.py with
  phacc; pyproject gained [tool.pytest.ini_options] asyncio_mode=
  auto + pythonpath=["."] (without pythonpath, custom_components
  is not importable from the tests). 12/12 green on the board.
- Deploy gotcha: `cp -r src/myhyundai_aircon dest/custom_components/`
  when custom_components does not yet exist copies src AS
  custom_components (rename semantics); ended up with the module
  spilled at the top level once — cleaned and re-copied properly.
- HA restarted and DISCOVERED the integration (loader warning
  logged). Live config-entry creation over REST is blocked: the
  stored ~/.ha_token (Jul 20) returns 401 — this venv install was
  reset mid-July and its admin password is neither arduino nor the
  onboarding default changeme. Two password guesses only, then
  stopped; need the real password from the user (or approval to
  reset it offline via `hass --script auth`).
- GitHub issue #17, branch feature/myhyundai-skeleton.
- Update (same day): the user could not recall the HA password and
  approved a reset. `hass --script auth list` showed the single
  user `arduino`; HA stopped, `change_password arduino arduino`
  (board-convention value, user advised to change it in the UI),
  HA restarted. Fresh 10-year long-lived token minted over the
  websocket API (client unoq-cli) into ~/.ha_token (API check 200).
  Config flow driven over REST: create_entry with state "loaded"
  on the first try. Stored entry verified in core.config_entries:
  unique_id R3CR80H1GBN (phone serial), baseline_screen 840x2289
  (Override preferred, as designed), host 192.168.31.113:5555,
  adbkey /home/arduino/.android/adbkey. HA auto-installed
  adb-shell[async]==0.4.4 into ha_venv from the manifest pin.
  Spec §11 stages 1-2 completion criteria fully met.

## 2026-09-01 — myhyundai_aircon PR 2: capture_dump + recipe engine
## (spec §11 stages 3-4)

Requested by user ("머지 후 진행해줘" after PR #18 merged). Second
code PR of the plan: the capture_dump service (UI-hierarchy XML via
uiautomator dump + screenshot via screencap/pull, saved under
config/myhyundai_aircon_dumps/ with a retention cap and a
persistent notification), recipe.py (JSON load, voluptuous schema
validation, placeholder detection, login_markers), executor.py
(all §8.3 step actions except await_notification which stays for
the notification PR; §8.4 node matching; bounds parsing; login-
marker session check), recipes/default.json placeholder draft, and
minimal run_sequence + reload_recipe services (run_sequence
serialized by a lock and firing the §9.4 result event; guards
arrive in PR 3). Unit tests on the board venv; live check =
capture_dump against the real phone. (see LP §3, §5)

- [x] recipe.py + recipes/default.json: schema validation, unknown
      action/missing field detection, placeholder scan, login
      markers
- [x] executor.py: UI dump parse + §8.4 matcher + bounds/center
      math + step actions (keyevent, wake, home, launch_app,
      stop_app, wait_focus, wait_node, tap_node, tap_ratio, swipe,
      sleep, assert_screen), optional-step semantics,
      E_SESSION_EXPIRED via login markers
- [x] capture_dump service + dump retention; run_sequence (lock +
      E_COOLDOWN on concurrent call + result event) and
      reload_recipe services; services.yaml + translations
- [x] Unit tests green on the board venv; ruff clean — 30 passed
      (12 from PR 1 + 18 new) in 3.36 s
- [x] Live verify: capture_dump on the real phone saves XML + PNG
      pair; reload_recipe works; run_sequence on the incomplete
      default recipe returns E_RECIPE_INCOMPLETE
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-01, PR 2)

- recipe.py validates against per-action voluptuous schemas (§8.3
  table), rejects shell-hostile package names and keyevent names by
  regex, recursively flags _PLACEHOLDER strings per sequence, and
  carries login_markers. The shipped recipes/default.json is the
  spec §8.5 draft verbatim plus a placeholder login marker.
- executor.py implements every §8.3 action except
  await_notification (raises E_NOT_IMPLEMENTED until the
  notification stage). §8.4 matching is AND-semantics with
  text_contains substring support, index pick, multi-match warning.
  E_SESSION_EXPIRED is checked on every UI dump against
  login_markers. run_sequence is serialized by an asyncio.Lock; a
  concurrent call gets E_COOLDOWN immediately (§10.1).
- Services registered from async_setup_entry: capture_dump (XML via
  uiautomator dump + PNG via screencap/adb pull, 40-file retention
  prune, persistent notification), run_sequence (fires the §9.4
  myhyundai_aircon_result event on success AND failure),
  reload_recipe.
- Board venv tests: 30/30 green. ruff check + format clean.
- Live on the real phone: capture_dump saved
  20260901-034112-widget.{xml,png} (real uiautomator hierarchy;
  screen was off so systemui was captured — mechanism verified),
  reload_recipe returned 200, run_sequence aircon_on failed exactly
  as designed with E_RECIPE_INCOMPLETE (spec test T9 behavior).
  Note: right after HA restart the REST service calls briefly
  returned 400 because the entry had not finished loading —
  retrying after load succeeded.
- GitHub issue #19, branch feature/myhyundai-recipe-engine.

## 2026-09-01 — myhyundai_aircon stage 5 gate: fill the recipe from
## real widget dumps

Requested by user ("진행해줘" after PR #20 merged). Spec §11 stage
5: wake the phone, capture the home-screen widget with the
integration's own capture_dump service, read the real node
identifiers (U3) out of the XML, and fill recipes/default.json with
them. The spec forbids guessing: only values read from actual dumps
go in. The confirm-popup steps (U4) and notification texts (U5/U6)
need one real remote command, which fires the actual car — that
run is coordinated with the user separately, so await_notification
keeps its placeholders for now and the sequence stays gated by
E_RECIPE_INCOMPLETE until then.

- [x] BLOCKED on user: the phone has a PIN lock screen (spec §12
      requires none). First wake+dump captured the swipe keyguard;
      `wm dismiss-keyguard` then raised the PIN bouncer
      (com.android.systemui pinEntry nodes in the dump), which must
      not be bypassed. User needs to set 설정 > 잠금화면 > 화면 잠금
      방식 > 없음 on the dedicated phone, then this gate resumes.
      — user removed the lock; next dump reached the home screen
- [x] Wake the phone and confirm the widget page is the current
      home screen, then capture_dump via the HA service
- [x] Identify the widget button nodes (켜기/잠금/시작/종료) in the
      XML: resource-id, text, content-desc, bounds
- [x] Fill the aircon_on tap step in recipes/default.json with the
      real identifier; keep await_notification placeholders until
      the observed real run
- [x] Update/extend unit tests for the filled recipe; all green on
      the board venv — 30 passed
- [x] Deploy + reload_recipe on the board; run_sequence must still
      refuse with E_RECIPE_INCOMPLETE (notification texts pending)
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-01, stage 5 gate)

- Dump 20260901-040751-widget_retry.xml (captured via the HA
  capture_dump service after the user removed the PIN lock) holds
  the full widget hierarchy: AppWidgetHostView desc "차량 상태와
  제어", package com.hyundai.oneapp.kr, on the default launcher
  page (page 1 of 2), showing 캐스퍼 Electric 98 % / 395 km.
- U3 answered: every widget button node has an EMPTY resource-id
  (RemoteViews); the reliable identifiers are the icon ImageViews'
  content-desc values — "공조 켜기", "공조 끄기", "문 잠금",
  "충전 시작" — with label TextViews 켜기/끄기/잠금/시작. The
  clickable element is each button's parent FrameLayout; the icon
  node's center lies inside it, so tap_node on the icon works.
- U7 answered YES: the widget has a dedicated 공조 끄기 button, so
  aircon_off is defined as a widget-path sequence symmetric to
  aircon_on (spec §6.1's no-off fallback is not needed).
- U9 re-confirmed and screen check: launcher focus is only visible
  via plain `dumpsys window` on this Android 15 build
  (`dumpsys window windows` is empty); the executor's existing
  fallback chain already handles it — mCurrentFocus shows
  LauncherActivity, so wait_focus "Launcher" works unchanged.
- recipes/default.json filled with the real content_desc matches
  for both sequences; confirm-popup steps left out until a real
  command is observed (U4); await_notification keeps placeholder
  texts so both sequences stay gated by E_RECIPE_INCOMPLETE.
- Verified: 30/30 tests on the board venv; reload_recipe 200 on
  the live HA; run_sequence aircon_on still correctly refuses with
  E_RECIPE_INCOMPLETE.
- Remaining for this gate (user coordination): one observed real
  aircon command for U4 (popup?) + U5/U6 (notification texts), and
  a logout dump for U8 (login_markers). GitHub issue #21, branch
  feature/myhyundai-recipe-values.

## 2026-09-01 — myhyundai_aircon PR 3: real-command observation +
## notification + entities + guards (spec §11 stages 6-8)

Requested by user ("나머지도 해보자" after PR #22 merged). Scope:
(a) one observed real aircon command via the widget — popup check
(U4), success notification text (U5), then immediately tap 공조
끄기 to restore state and capture the off text too; (b) fill the
recipe notification texts, completing the stage-5 gate; (c)
notification.py (§9.2 failure-first judging over dumpsys
notification --noredact) wired into the executor's
await_notification step; (d) switch/sensor/binary_sensor entities
(§6) with the auto-OFF timer; (e) §5.2 options flow + §9.3 guards
(cooldown, min gap, battery floor) and retry logic. U6 (failure
text) cannot be induced remotely; the parser treats it as optional
data. U8 (login markers) stays open. (see LP §3, §5)

- [x] Observe one real aircon_on via widget tap over ADB: popup
      yes/no, dumpsys notification success text; then aircon_off
      tap + its notification text
- [x] Fill recipes/default.json notification texts (and popup
      steps if any); sequences become runnable
- [x] notification.py: package-block extraction tolerant of

- [ ] Record results below (final results after the entities PR)

### Interim results (2026-09-01, PR 3a: observation + notification)

- Real-command observation (user-approved): tapping 공조 켜기 at
  (162,819) fired the command with NO confirm popup (U4 = none;
  post-tap dump shows the plain widget). Result push arrived 21 s
  later. U5 texts: title "원격제어 결과 안내", body/ticker
  "공조가 켜졌습니다." The off button observed symmetrically:
  "공조가 꺼졌습니다." (3 s — vehicle session already warm). U6
  failure text remains unobserved; failure_contains is an empty
  list, so a real failure judges as E_TIMEOUT + retry (documented
  in the recipe description). Gotcha (LP-worthy): piping a script
  into `ssh bash -s` dies silently when the script calls adb —
  adb shell EATS the remaining script from stdin; copy the script
  to the board and run it from a file instead.
- Notification format on One UI / Android 15: active records are
  "NotificationRecord(... pkg=... key=...:" blocks whose text
  lives in tickerText= / android.title=String (...) /
  android.text=String (...); the archive holds text-less
  StatusBarNotification lines that can never false-match.
  notification.py parses per-record blobs keyed by the record key.
  Spec §9.2's clear-before-run needs permissions ADB lacks, so the
  executor snapshots the package's record KEYS at sequence start
  and judges only records that appear afterwards — same intent,
  no clearing.
- recipes/default.json is now COMPLETE (no placeholders in the
  sequences): both sequences runnable.
- Tests 36/36 green on the board venv; ruff clean.
- LIVE END-TO-END through Home Assistant: run_sequence aircon_on →
  HTTP 200 in 31.5 s (wake → home → widget tap → notification
  judged success); run_sequence aircon_off → HTTP 200 in 10.1 s,
  vehicle restored. The spec's core mission works.

### Final results (2026-09-01, PR 3b: entities + guards)

- Coordinator now orchestrates runs: §9 guards (min gap, cooldown
  after success, battery floor via a configurable sensor entity),
  §9.3 retry ladder (E_TIMEOUT -> am force-stop + retry,
  E_VEHICLE_FAIL -> retry_gap wait + retry, up to retry_max),
  whole-sequence asyncio.timeout, dump-on-failure hook, last-run
  state for the entities, and the §9.4 result event on success and
  failure. run_sequence routes through it (ignore_guards honored).
- Entities land with exactly the spec §6 IDs: switch.myhyundai_
  aircon (assumed_state, §6.1 attributes, auto-OFF timer via
  async_call_later — the timer callback needed @callback, caught
  by a thread-safety RuntimeError in the board test run),
  sensor.myhyundai_last_result / last_error / last_notification,
  binary_sensor.myhyundai_device_connected (stays available so OFF
  is visible).
- Options flow exposes the §5.2 tuning values (the notification
  wait limit stays recipe-side — documented deviation); options
  changes reload the entry. strings + en/ko translations updated.
- Tests: 46/46 on the board venv (guards, retries, event payload,
  switch auto-off via time jump); ruff clean.
- LIVE full-stack verification on the real car: switch.turn_on ->
  32.5 s, state on, expires_at ~+10 min, screen_checked 840x2289,
  sensors success + "공조가 켜졌습니다."; after the 60 s cooldown,
  switch.turn_off -> 10.4 s, state off, expires_at cleared,
  "공조가 꺼졌습니다.". Design note: the cooldown guard also
  blocks turn_off right after turn_on (60 s default) — spec-
  faithful; revisit if it bothers the user in practice.
- Remaining project work: docs PR (README, §12 device-prep table,
  HACS shape) and the open observations U6 (failure text) + U8
  (login markers), both fillable later via recipe edits alone.

## 2026-09-01 — myhyundai_aircon PR 4: documentation (spec §11
## stage 9)

Requested by user ("그렇게해줘. 그리고 main 브랜치에도 포함해줘"
after PR #25 merged). Final PR of the plan: a full guide document
(docs/myhyundai-aircon-guide.md, English per CLAUDE.md §2) with the
spec §12 device-prep table, install/config/usage, error-code
reference, recipe-editing instructions for the still-open U6/U8
values, and the §15 caveats; a myhyundai_aircon section in
README.md; and a root hacs.json for the HACS-capable shape. Merge
to main afterwards per the user's request. ko/en entity
translations already shipped with the code PRs.

- [x] Write docs/myhyundai-aircon-guide.md
- [x] Add the component to README.md (what was built, verified
      results, repo layout)
- [x] Add hacs.json (HACS custom-repository shape)
- [x] PR + merge to main
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-01, PR 4: documentation)

- docs/myhyundai-aircon-guide.md covers: architecture, the §12
  phone-prep table with the two hardware-proven REQUIRED rows (USB
  debugging, lock screen NONE — the PIN incident), venv-install
  deploy commands for this rig, config-flow and options reference
  (incl. the do-not-lower-cooldown §15 warning), entity/service/
  event reference with the cooldown-blocks-immediate-OFF note, the
  §9.3 error-code table, UNO Q rig specifics (adb-local client,
  TCP re-arm after phone reboot), and recipe-maintenance
  instructions for the still-open U6/U8 values.
- README: component added to the intro, verified-results row, and
  repo-layout rows (guide, spec, custom_components/, tests/).
- hacs.json added for the HACS custom-repository shape (spec §3).
- Spec §11 is now complete: stages 1-9 all delivered and the whole
  stack verified on the real vehicle. Project remains at 0.1.0
  until U6/U8 are observed in the wild.

## 2026-09-01 — Tapo P110M plugs on the venv HA + top-3 HACS themes

Requested by user. Two parts: (a) discover the TP-Link Tapo P110M
plugs on this network (192.168.31.x — DormTapo1/2 were seen at
.19/.240 by the 2026-07-27 session on the other board) and register
them in the SungwooQ venv HA 2026.2.3; KLAP registration will need
the user's TP-Link account credentials (never stored in this repo).
(b) survey the currently popular HACS themes and summarize the top
three. (see LP §3: python-kasa unicast probe, WebSocket flow
inspection; ha_add_tapo.sh in claude_test/)

- [x] Probe the /24 for Tapo plugs (claude_test/probe_all.py) and
      check HA's tplink discovery flows — both P110M(KR) found:
      192.168.31.19 (18:69:45:71:0C:49) and 192.168.31.240
      (18:69:45:71:05:EC), same as the 2026-07-27 records; HA's
      only pending discovery flow is the MiWiFi router (upnp)
- [x] BLOCKED on user: register both plugs — KLAP needs the
      TP-Link account credentials (verify with python-kasa first
      per LP §2; never stored in the repo) — user provided them in
      chat; verified against .19 with the kasa CLI, then both
      registered via ha_add_tapo.sh (DormTapo1 P110M and DormTapo2
      P110M create_entry; the second flow reused HA's stored
      credentials and skipped the auth step)
- [x] Verify entities + a safe toggle test on one plug — 32 tapo
      entities incl. current_consumption sensors (0.4 W / 1.7 W,
      safe); toggle_test.sh on switch.dormtapo1 6/6 OK at 3 s
      cadence; plug restored to its initial ON state afterwards.
      Gotcha repeat: the script streamed from this Windows
      checkout needed CRLF stripping (sed on the fly) — LP §5
      pattern, ssh-stream variant
- [x] Research and summarize the top-3 HACS themes — by GitHub
      hacs-theme topic stars + community citations: ① Frosted
      Glass (wessamlauf, ~988★, glassmorphism) ② Graphite
      (TilmanGriesel, ~455★, calm auto light/dark) ③ Catppuccin
      (4 pastel flavors; already proven on the other rig as
      default Mocha). Runner-up: Material You / Material Design 3
      (Nerwyn, ~466★). Full comparison delivered in chat;
      background in docs/ha-dashboard-research.md (other session's
      uncommitted file, untouched)
- [x] Apply the user-chosen Graphite theme (added mid-task): theme
      yamls (dark/light/auto) downloaded into ha_config/themes/,
      `frontend: themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes` appended
      to configuration.yaml (single-file backup kept as
      configuration.yaml.bak-20260901), config validated with
      `hass --script check_config`, HA restarted, default theme
      set to "Graphite Auto" via frontend.set_theme — verified
      over the websocket API (3 themes loaded, default confirmed);
      Tapo (32) and myhyundai (5) entities all alive post-restart
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-01)

- Plugs: DormTapo1 (192.168.31.19) and DormTapo2 (192.168.31.240)
  registered in the venv HA with full entity sets incl. energy
  sensors; end-to-end toggle verified 6/6 and initial state
  restored.
- Theme: Graphite (TilmanGriesel) installed manually (no HACS on
  this HA — same OAuth-interactive limitation as the 2026-07-27
  rig); "Graphite Auto" is the backend default so it follows
  light/dark automatically for all users.
- Theme survey delivered in chat: ① Frosted Glass (~988★)
  ② Graphite (~455★, chosen) ③ Catppuccin, runner-up Material
  You (~466★).

## 2026-09-01 — README update for this session's work

Requested by user ("지금까지 작업한걸 README.md에도 작성해줘").
Fold the 2026-09-01 session into README.md: the second rig reality
(SungwooQ runs HA Core in a venv, not the container described so
far), the vehicle-control path in the architecture diagram, the
myhyundai_aircon build summary, Tapo re-registration on the venv
rig, the Graphite theme, and the new hardware gotchas (adb eats
ssh-streamed scripts; Debian adb vs Arduino android libs).

- [x] Update intro, diagram, "What was built", verified results,
      and gotchas in README.md
- [x] PR + merge to main
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-01)

- Intro now names both verified HA install styles; the diagram
  gained the phone → Bluelink → vehicle branch; "What was built"
  gained the myhyundai_aircon summary (recipes, guards, 46 tests,
  7 PRs in one day) and the Graphite theme; verified-results table
  gained the venv-rig Tapo re-registration and theme rows; gotchas
  gained adb-eats-stdin, the Debian-adb conflict, and the
  two-rigs-two-layouts warning.

## 2026-09-02 — myhyundai_aircon: vehicle data sensors from the
## widget (read-only scraping)

Requested by user; scope confirmed in chat after a fresh-dump data
survey (values live: 93 % / 367 km / 문잠김 / 오전 8:07 기준 /
캐스퍼 Electric / 업데이트-가능 icon). In scope: EV battery %,
range km, doors-locked binary, data-timestamp (Korean 오전/오후
parsing with day rollback), vehicle name attribute, plus a
MyHyundai app-version sensor (dumpsys package) as an early-warning
for UI-breaking updates. Read-only — no vehicle commands; the
widget refresh tap stays OUT (may ping the car). Charging state
and the update-available flag wait for real observation. Polling
piggybacks the coordinator at a configurable interval (default
15 min, 0 disables), serialized behind the executor lock so it
never overlaps a running sequence. (see LP §3, §5)

- [x] vehicle_data.py: node-list parser (battery/range/doors/
      timestamp/name/update-available) + app-version parser, unit
      tests from the real dump values
- [x] executor.async_snapshot_home_nodes (wake → home → dump under
      the lock; parsing lives in the coordinator to avoid a
      circular import); coordinator piggyback poll +
      vehicle_poll_minutes option (+ strings/translations)
- [x] New entities: sensor.myhyundai_vehicle_battery / _vehicle
      _range / _data_updated_at / _app_version and
      binary_sensor.myhyundai_doors_locked
- [x] Tests green on the board venv; ruff clean — 52 passed
- [x] Deploy + live verify sensor values against the real widget
- [x] Update the component guide's entity table
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- Live values on first verified poll: battery 93 %, range 367 km,
  doors_locked on (문잠김), data_updated_at 08:07 KST (matches the
  widget exactly), app_version 1.5.1.
- Two bugs found during live verification: (1) the vehicle poll
  was only wired into the reconnect branch of _async_update_data —
  the steady-state early return skipped it; (2) the very first
  refresh runs before the executor is attached, so setup now
  requests one more (debounced) refresh after wiring. Both fixed
  and covered by the deploy re-test.
- Timezone gotcha: this headlessly onboarded HA had time_zone=UTC,
  which anchored the Korean widget clock 9 h off. REST
  /api/config/core/update ignored the change; the WEBSOCKET
  config/core/update set Asia/Seoul successfully (needs restart).
  Recorded for LearnedPatterns.
- 52/52 tests on the board venv; scrape is read-only, lock-safe,
  refresh control never tapped. GitHub issue #32, branch
  feature/myhyundai-vehicle-data.

## 2026-09-02 — Experiment: does the widget reveal the live
## climate state?

Requested by user ("한번 실험을 진행해보자"). The aircon switch is
assumed-state (spec §1.4); if the widget's status area changes
while the climate actually runs, a real climate-state sensor (and
optional switch-state correction) becomes possible. Protocol: OFF
baseline dump → aircon_on via the switch (1 real command) → dumps
at ~+15 s and ~+75 s while ON → aircon_off after the 60 s cooldown
(vehicle restored) → post-OFF dump → node-level diff of the
MyHyundai widget subtree across all dumps. If a marker is found,
implement the sensor in this same branch; if not, record the
negative result and keep the switch optimistic.

- [x] Run the on/off observation protocol and collect dumps
- [x] Diff the widget nodes across OFF/ON/OFF states
- [x] If a marker exists: parser + binary_sensor + tests + deploy;
      else record the negative finding
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- Node-level diff: NO text/desc marker — the widget's texts are
  identical across OFF/ON/OFF except live data (timestamp
  refreshed on each command result: 8:07→8:57→8:59; range
  367→366 km while climate ran →375 km after — the app refreshes
  widget data on every command push, a useful side-finding).
- SCREENSHOT diff found the marker: while climate runs, the widget
  draws a light-blue AURA around the car image; it vanished in the
  post-off capture, correlating exactly with state (the battery
  icon color also changed but tracks data generation, not
  climate — rejected as a marker).
- Pixel metric calibrated on the four real captures: fraction of
  pixels with B>150 and B>R+20 inside the 차량-상태 region =
  0.0151 when ON, exactly 0.0000 when OFF (both OFF captures).
  Threshold 0.005 → 3x margin, zero false-positive headroom needed.
- Implemented: measure_glow_fraction + find_vehicle_image_bounds
  in vehicle_data.py (Pillow imported lazily — present in the HA
  venv, degrades to unknown if absent), screenshot captured INSIDE
  the executor lock so it always matches the node dump,
  coordinator glow judging, binary_sensor.myhyundai_climate_
  running (device_class running, glow_fraction attribute), and a
  post-command poll reset so the sensor catches up within ~30 s of
  any switch action.
- 54/54 tests on the board venv (incl. synthetic-image metric
  tests); live deploy verified climate_running=off /
  glow_fraction=0.0 against the real idle vehicle. ON-state
  detection stands on the real calibration captures. Cost: one
  aircon on/off cycle, vehicle restored. GitHub issue #34, branch
  feature/myhyundai-climate-state.

## 2026-09-02 — Widget force-refresh every 3 minutes

Requested by user; the 12V/telematics drain concern was explicitly
waived by them ("텔레매틱스로 인한 배터리 고갈은 문제없을 것
같아. 명령을 보낼때를 제외하고 3분마다 갱신하도록 해줘"). Design:
a new data-only "widget_refresh" recipe sequence taps the widget's
timestamp/refresh control (text_contains "기준" — present in every
dump; the clickable parent area covers it); the coordinator runs it
at the top of each vehicle poll when the new widget_refresh_enabled
option is on, THEN scrapes, so sensors always read post-refresh
data. Runs through the executor lock, so an in-flight command makes
the refresh (and poll) skip — exactly the requested "except while
commanding". Refresh failures degrade to scraping stale data. Live
options set to vehicle_poll_minutes=3 + widget_refresh_enabled.

- [x] recipes/default.json: widget_refresh sequence (data-only,
      taps text_contains "기준", waits for "km" to reappear)
- [x] const/options/strings: widget_refresh_enabled (default off)
- [x] Coordinator: settled glow snapshot -> refresh -> fresh
      re-scrape; silent skip while a sequence runs
- [x] Tests green on the board venv; ruff clean — 57 passed
- [x] Deploy, set live options (3 min + refresh on), verify
      data_updated_at advances on its own
- [x] Update guide; record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- widget_refresh sequence added (wake/home/wait-launcher/tap 기준/
  sleep/wait-km). widget_refresh_enabled option (default off) with
  a "may query the vehicle" warning in both languages. The empty
  EntitySelector for battery_sensor had to drop its "" default —
  an empty entity id fails validation on options submit; fixed.
- MAJOR live finding: the blue car aura is NOT a climate-only
  indicator — it marks ACTIVE REMOTE COMMUNICATION and clears ~30 s
  after it settles (measured 0.0151 right after a refresh tap, 0.0
  at t+30 s). So tapping refresh then screenshotting immediately
  false-positived climate_running. Fix: judge glow from the
  SETTLED snapshot taken BEFORE the refresh tap; read fresh data
  from a second snapshot AFTER the refresh. Also added an
  incomplete-scrape guard (battery/range hidden mid-refresh keeps
  the previous values).
- Live verified with vehicle_poll_minutes=3 + widget_refresh on:
  data_updated_at tracked ~1 min behind real time (e.g. 9:53 data
  read at 9:54 — refresh working), range moved 367→365→374 across
  refreshes, climate_running=off / glow 0.0 (false-positive gone).
- 57/57 tests on the board venv; ruff clean. GitHub issue #36,
  branch feature/myhyundai-widget-refresh. NOTE: climate_running
  now reflects the pre-refresh settled state; its reliability
  across a full 10-min climate session is only partially
  characterized (glow seen sustained ~83 s post aircon-on in the
  PR#35 experiment) — documented as best-effort with the
  glow_fraction attribute exposed for tuning.

## 2026-09-02 — README update for the vehicle-data work

Requested by user ("지금까지 작업한 걸 README.md에 기록하고 main
에도 반영해줘"). Fold the three post-documentation PRs (#33 vehicle
data sensors, #35 climate-state glow detection, #37 widget
force-refresh) into README.md and merge to main.

- [x] Update intro, "What was built", verified results, and
      gotchas in README.md
- [x] PR + merge to main
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- Intro and diagram now show the read-only scrape arrow back from
  the vehicle; "What was built" gained three bullets (telemetry
  without an API, real climate state via glow analysis, opt-in
  force-refresh with the settled-before-refresh ordering) and the
  test count moved 46 -> 57; verified-results table gained three
  rows (live telemetry values, glow calibration, 3-min refresh
  freshness); gotchas gained the UTC-timezone trap and the
  "a visual marker may mean something broader than it looks"
  lesson from the aura finding.

## 2026-09-02 — Restart Home Assistant (operational request)

Requested by user ("홈 어시스턴트 서버를 재시작해줘"). Operational
task, no repo code involved.

- [x] Restart home-assistant.service and confirm it comes back
- [x] Verify health after the restart
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- `systemctl restart home-assistant`: back with HTTP 200 in ~20 s,
  service active (running), ExecMainStart 01:17:39 UTC, frontend
  200. No integration errors in the post-restart log; the only
  warnings are this board's usual ones (no ffmpeg binary,
  Bluetooth NET_ADMIN/NET_RAW permissions, libturbojpeg missing) —
  none related to our components.
- FINDING: the stored long-lived token in /home/arduino/.ha_token
  no longer authenticates (401 on REST, auth_invalid on the
  websocket) and the previously set password `arduino` no longer
  logs in. The auth stores were rewritten at 01:15/01:16, i.e.
  BEFORE this restart (01:17) — so the credentials were changed
  outside this session, most likely the user changing the password
  in the web UI as previously recommended. Deliberately did NOT
  reset the password again (that would clobber the user's own
  choice); health was verified from logs and systemd instead.
  Next API-driven work needs either the new password (to mint a
  token) or a token created in the UI.

### Follow-up (2026-09-02): password reset on user request

The user could not log in with their own new password either and
asked for a reset. Repeated the offline procedure: HA stopped,
`hass --script auth change_password arduino arduino`, HA started
(HTTP 200). Login verified, fresh 10-year token minted over the
websocket (client unoq-cli-20260902) into ~/.ha_token, API check
200. Entities healthy: 11 myhyundai + 32 tapo of 61 total;
vehicle_range briefly read unknown on the first post-restart poll
(the scrape landed mid-refresh while the coordinator had no prior
snapshot to fall back on, so the incomplete-scrape guard could not
apply) and recovered to 374 km on the next 3-minute cycle —
cosmetic, self-healing, worth a guard tweak only if it recurs.
Password is `arduino` again; user advised to change it in the UI
and hand over a token if they want API work to keep working.

## 2026-09-02 — Full built-in LED control from Home Assistant

Requested by user ("아두이노 우노 Q에 내장된 led의 종류를 파악하고
이를 홈 어시스턴트에서 제어할 수 있도록 설정해줘"). Investigation
first: the live rig exposes only LED3, as 8 on/off colours, through a
template light -> shell_command -> led3_ctl App Lab app whose Bridge
RPC is `set_rgb(bool, bool, bool)` — brightness and every non-primary
colour are silently discarded. The Zephyr devicetree
(`firmwares/zephyr-arduino_uno_q_stm32u585xx.dts`) shows LED3's three
channels ARE mapped to TIM5 PWM at 500 Hz with inverted polarity, so
true 24-bit colour plus brightness is available through
`analogWrite()` and is simply unused today.

LED inventory (devicetree /leds node + /sys/class/leds):

| LED | Pins | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| LED3 R/G/B | PH10/PH11/PH12, active-low | PWM (pwm5 ch1-3) — full colour + brightness |
| LED4 R/G/B | PH13/PH14/PH15, active-low | GPIO only — 8 colours |
| 8x13 blue matrix (104 LEDs) | matrixBegin/matrixWrite | pixel on/off, no brightness |
| red/green/blue:user, blue:bt, green:wlan, red:panic | Linux `/sys/class/leds` | on/off (max_brightness=1), physical presence unverified |

User decisions: MQTT Discovery transport (replacing the HTTP +
template light path); expose LED3 (PWM full colour + brightness) and
LED4 (8-colour light); do NOT expose the matrix or the Linux LEDs;
KEEP the existing CPU/memory bar display on the matrix unchanged.
(see LP §3, §5)

- [x] Live-verify `analogWrite()` on LED3 (PH10-12) — the pins are
      claimed by the gpio-leds driver, so confirm PWM re-configures
      them; fall back to software PWM in the sketch if it does not
- [x] Sketch: add `set_led3_rgb(int, int, int)` (PWM, 0-255 per
      channel) and `set_led4_rgb(bool, bool, bool)`; keep
      `set_pin_by_name` and `show_load` (matrix bars) untouched
- [x] Python bridge: replace the six per-channel MQTT switches with
      two MQTT Discovery lights — `unoq_led3` (JSON schema, rgb +
      brightness) and `unoq_led4` (JSON schema, rgb quantized to the
      8 reachable colours); retained state topics + availability
- [x] Restore the MQTT broker: mosquitto container from
      `apps/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`, then register the HA MQTT
      integration with `claude_test/ha_add_mqtt.sh`
- [x] Unit tests under `tests/` for the colour/brightness -> duty
      mapping and the LED4 quantization; ruff clean
- [x] Deploy: start `ha-mcu-bridge` (this stops `led3_ctl` — only one
      App Lab app runs at a time and the MCU is re-flashed), set it as
      the default app, remove the now-dead `light:` template and
      `shell_command:` blocks from configuration.yaml (backup first),
      restart HA
- [x] Verify end to end from the HA API: LED3 arbitrary colour, LED3
      brightness sweep, LED4 colours, matrix bars still running
- [x] Update README.md and docs/home-assistant-uno-q-guide.md; append
      any new lesson to LearnedPatterns.md
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- PWM on LED3 CONFIRMED on hardware, but only after a false negative
  that mattered: the first breathing sweep showed nothing at all, and
  the cause was the probe's own `/gpio` call earlier in that MCU
  session. `analogWrite()` never re-applies pinctrl, so one
  `pinMode`/`digitalWrite` leaves the pad in GPIO mode for good. After
  re-flashing with no GPIO call, the same sweep was smooth. The
  production sketch therefore drops LED3 from `kPins` entirely and
  initialises it with `analogWrite(0)`.
- Two dead ends recorded so they are not retried: `pwm_pin_index()`
  cannot be called from a sketch (GCC inlines it into `analogWrite`;
  no symbol in `core.a`), and `syms-dynamic.ld` exports no PWM symbols
  — irrelevant, since Zephyr reaches the driver through the device API
  pointer. The mapping was confirmed statically instead: `LED_BUILTIN`
  = 50 (`gpioh 0xa` in `digital-pin-gpios`), and `gpioh 0xa/b/c` are
  entries 6/7/8 of `pwm-pin-gpios` → pwm5 ch1-3, 500 Hz, inverted
  polarity (so 255 = full brightness).
- Entities: `light.uno_q_mcu_led3` (rgb + brightness) and
  `light.uno_q_mcu_led4` (rgb, quantized) discovered automatically;
  both report real state — `assumed_state` is gone, unlike the
  template light they replace. Duty values verified from the bridge
  log: magenta @ brightness 64 → `(64, 0, 64)`, full green →
  `(0, 255, 0)`, LED4 red → `(255, 0, 0)`, LED4 red @ brightness 100 →
  `(0, 0, 0)` (quantization is the only dimming a GPIO-only LED has).
- Visually confirmed by the user on the real board: LED3 sweeps
  brightness smoothly under HA control, LED4 cycles all seven lit
  colours.
- Broker restored (`eclipse-mosquitto:2`, host network, 127.0.0.1 +
  172.17.0.1 listeners) and the HA MQTT integration re-registered
  (`create_entry`, state loaded). `ha-mcu-bridge` set as the default
  App Lab app so it survives reboots; the matrix CPU/memory bars are
  running again with zero `stats push failed` entries in the log.
- Old path retired: `light:` template and `shell_command:` removed
  from configuration.yaml (backup `configuration.yaml.bak-20260902`),
  config validated, HA restarted, and the orphaned
  `light.led3_rgb` registry entry deleted.
- Tests: 67 passed on the board venv (57 existing + 10 new for the
  colour mapping); ruff clean. GitHub issue #40, branch
  feature/unoq-led-mqtt-lights.
- NOT done, by user scope decision: the 8x13 matrix and the Linux
  `/sys/class/leds` devices are still not exposed to HA. The six
  Linux LED class devices remain unverified as physical LEDs on this
  board — they report `max_brightness=1` and were never lit for a
  visual check.


## 2026-09-02 — Surface the LED colour controls on a dashboard

Requested by user ("지금 보니 led 껐다키는 것 만 HA 노출되어있는데
RGB 모두 제어할 수 있게 해줘"). Diagnosis first: the entities are
already full RGB lights — `light.uno_q_mcu_led3` and
`light.uno_q_mcu_led4` both report `supported_color_modes: ["rgb"]`
and `supported_features: 40`, and driving them with `rgb_color` and
`brightness` over the REST API reaches the hardware. What the user is
seeing is the main `Overview`, which is an AUTO-GENERATED dashboard:
its Entities card renders a light as a single row with a toggle, and
the colour wheel and brightness slider only appear in the more-info
dialog behind the entity name. The only custom dashboard on this rig
is `Map`.

User decision: add a new dedicated dashboard rather than taking
control of `Overview` (taking control would permanently stop
auto-generation for every future entity). (see LP §3)

- [x] Dashboard config as version-controlled YAML in the repo, with
      a `light` card per LED plus one-tap colour buttons for LED4
- [x] Installer script that creates the dashboard and saves its
      config over the HA WebSocket API
- [x] Install on the board and verify the dashboard renders with the
      colour controls visible without opening more-info
- [x] Document where the colour controls live in the auto-generated
      Overview too, so the original confusion is recorded
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- Root cause confirmed as UI-only. Nothing was wrong with the
  entities: both already reported `supported_color_modes: ["rgb"]`
  and `supported_features: 40`, and REST calls with `rgb_color` +
  `brightness` reached the hardware. `lovelace_dashboards` held just
  one item (`Map`), so the main Overview was the auto-generated
  strategy dashboard, whose Entities-card row for a light shows only
  a toggle.
- New `/uno-q` dashboard ("UNO Q" in the sidebar, storage mode), one
  view with 5 cards: a markdown note explaining the LED3/LED4
  difference, a `light` card per LED, an inline `light-brightness`
  tile for LED3, and a 4-column grid of 8 one-tap colour buttons for
  LED4. Overview is untouched and still auto-generates.
- `claude_test/ha_add_dashboard.py` does both WebSocket steps
  (`lovelace/dashboards/create` + `lovelace/config/save`) and is
  idempotent: an existing url_path is reused and its config
  overwritten.
- Button payloads verified end to end before handing over — the Cyan
  button's exact service data produced `led4 -> ON (0, 255, 255)` in
  the bridge log, and the Off button `led4 -> OFF (0, 0, 0)`.
- User confirmed the dashboard renders with the colour and brightness
  controls visible.
- Two gotchas recorded in claude_test/README.md and guide §9f:
  `url_path` must contain a hyphen or HA rejects it, and
  `.storage/lovelace_dashboards` lags the live state by seconds — the
  file still showed only `Map` right after a successful create, so
  verify with `lovelace/dashboards/list` instead.
- GitHub issue #42, branch feature/unoq-led-dashboard, stacked on the
  still-open PR #41 (its entity ids are what the dashboard targets).



## 2026-09-02 — Green LED4 when the phone is off the dorm WiFi

Requested by user ("내 스마트폰의 와이파이가 이름이 XiaomiDorm55가
아니면 아두이노의 LED4를 녹색으로 빛나게해줘"). The phone already
reports its SSID to HA through the companion app:
`sensor.sm_f966n_wi_fi_connection` (currently `WUNIST_AAA`), so no new
integration is needed — only an automation driving
`light.uno_q_mcu_led4`.

Two behaviours confirmed with the user before starting:
- Back on `XiaomiDorm55` -> LED4 **blue**, not off.
- No WiFi at all (LTE only, `unavailable`/`unknown`) counts as "not
  XiaomiDorm55" -> **green**. The condition is a literal SSID mismatch.

Blocker found while surveying: `configuration.yaml` on the board is the
scripted minimal one (`default_config:` + themes) and never got the
standard `automation: !include automations.yaml` line, so HA loads zero
automations no matter what the UI writes.

- [x] Version-controlled automation YAML in the repo, next to the
      dashboard config (`apps/ha-automations/`)
- [x] Add the missing `automation:` include to the board's
      `configuration.yaml` (back it up first, as in the 2026-09-02
      shell_command removal)
- [x] Installer script under `claude_test/` that pushes the automation
      over the HA REST config API and reloads it
- [x] Verify on the real hardware through the webcam pointed at the
      board: force both SSID values and confirm blue vs green
- [x] Update README.md / docs and append any new lesson to
      LearnedPatterns.md
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- GitHub issue #44, branch feature/phone-wifi-led4, stacked on
  feature/unoq-led-dashboard (PR #43) because the automation targets
  `light.uno_q_mcu_led4`, which arrives with the still-open PR #41.
- The blocker was real and silent: with only `default_config:` in
  `configuration.yaml`, the config API returned `{"result": "ok"}` and
  wrote `automations.yaml`, but HA never read the file. Adding
  `automation: !include automations.yaml` (backup
  `configuration.yaml.bak-20260902-automation`) plus an empty
  `automations.yaml` fixed it; `check_config` returned `valid` and
  `automation.reload` was enough -- no restart required.
  `ha_add_automation.py` now re-reads the entity list after the reload
  and fails loudly if the automation did not appear, so the same
  silent failure cannot repeat.
- A third trigger was added after the first restart test: MQTT
  Discovery re-created the light entities roughly 20 s AFTER
  `homeassistant.start` fired, so the start trigger alone cannot be
  trusted to restore the colour. The automation now also triggers on
  `light.uno_q_mcu_led4` leaving `unavailable`, which additionally
  covers the App Lab app restarting by itself (the sketch turns both
  LEDs off in `setup()`).
- Verified on the real board through the webcam on the user's PC
  (`claude_test/cam_snap.py`), with the SSID forced through the REST
  API since the user was away:
  - `XiaomiDorm55` -> `led4 -> ON (0, 0, 255)`, blue in the frame.
  - `<not connected>` -> `led4 -> ON (0, 255, 0)`, green in the frame.
  - real value `WUNIST_AAA` restored -> green, as intended.
  - full HA restart -> automation reloaded from the include and
    LED4 green, no errors in the log.
  - full App Lab bridge restart (MCU re-flash included) -> the
    availability trigger re-applied green within seconds; confirmed
    both in the bridge log and on camera.
- The webcam capture path cost two dead ends worth recording:
  `ffmpeg -f dshow` on this host rejects every explicit
  `-video_size`/`-framerate` ("Could not set video options") and its
  default mode is 160x120; OpenCV's DSHOW backend opens fine but
  ignores the size properties too, yielding 640x480 regardless of what
  is requested. 640x480 turned out to be plenty to read one LED.
- Ruff clean on both new scripts. No unit tests added: the change is
  declarative YAML plus two one-off installer/diagnostic scripts, and
  the behaviour was verified against the hardware instead.


## 2026-09-02 — Third colour: red when off both known networks

Requested by user ("TP-Link_0624를 녹색으로 하고 이 2개의 wifi가
아님 빨강이도록 자동화 스크립트를 구성해줘"). The indicator gains a
third state, so it now distinguishes "which known network" from "no
known network" instead of only "dorm or not":

- `XiaomiDorm55` -> blue (unchanged)
- `TP-Link_0624` -> green (was the catch-all colour)
- anything else, including no WiFi at all -> red (new)

Continues issue #44 on the same branch rather than opening a new one:
PR #45 is still open and this edits the very file it introduces, so a
separate stacked PR would only fragment the review.

- [x] Add the TP-Link_0624 branch and repoint the default to red
- [x] Reinstall on the board and verify all three colours on camera
- [x] Update the guide, README and PR/issue text
- [x] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-02)

- The `choose` gained a second branch (`TP-Link_0624` -> green) and
  the `default:` became red, so "no known network" now reads
  differently from "the other known network". Adding a third network
  later is one more branch and no change to the default.
- Verified on the board through the webcam, forcing the SSID over the
  REST API:
  - `XiaomiDorm55` -> `(0, 0, 255)`, blue on camera.
  - `TP-Link_0624` -> `(0, 255, 0)`, green on camera.
  - `<not connected>` -> `(255, 0, 0)`, red on camera.
  - `OtherCafeWiFi` (an SSID the automation has never seen) ->
    `(255, 0, 0)`, confirming the default branch is not just the
    disconnected case.
- Worth remembering: `automation.reload` installs the new config but
  does NOT re-run it, so LED4 kept the colour the previous version
  had set. It looked correct here only because the phone was on
  TP-Link_0624, which is green under both versions -- the three
  colours had to be forced individually to actually prove anything.
- Committed onto the existing branch and PR #45 rather than opening
  a second stacked PR; issue #44 and the PR body were updated to the
  three-colour behaviour.

## 2026-09-04 — Monitor plug follows the phone onto the dorm WiFi

Requested by user: the monitor's smart plug should be on only while
the phone is connected to `XiaomiDorm55`. User decisions taken up
front: dorm membership is `XiaomiDorm55` alone (not the three-SSID
set that phone-wifi-led4.yaml treats as "the dorm"), turning on is
immediate, and leaving the network turns the plug off after a hold.
GitHub issue #50. (see LP §2)

Input validation, before writing this entry:

- Plug identity resolved against the live board, not the repo. The
  2026-07-13 entries name `switch.tapo_p1` / `switch.tapo_p2`; both
  have since been renamed in the Tapo app, and HA now exposes
  `switch.dormtapo1` = "기숙사-모니터" (the monitor, the target here)
  and `switch.dormtapo2` = "기숙사-충전기".
- Recorder checked for 7 days of `sensor.sm_f966n_wi_fi_connection`
  before choosing the SSID set and the hold, per LP §2: XiaomiDorm55
  holds 18.79 h, ASUS_55 and ASUS_55_24 hold 0.00 h each (one
  momentary sample apiece, 2026-09-02 13:42). The phone does not in
  fact roam between the dorm's three SSIDs, so "XiaomiDorm55 only" is
  not the trap it looked like. One real excursion lasted 0.1 min
  (6 s) and returned, which is what the hold has to absorb.

- [x] Write `apps/ha-automations/dorm-monitor-plug.yaml`: turn
      `switch.dormtapo1` on when the SSID becomes `XiaomiDorm55`, and
      off once it has been anything else for two minutes
- [x] Keep `unavailable` / `unknown` out of the off path -- losing
      contact with the phone must never cut power to a monitor the
      user may be sitting in front of (LP §2)
- [x] Install on the board with `claude_test/ha_add_automation.py`
      and confirm it loaded as an `automation.*` entity (LP §2)
- [x] Verify both directions live against the real plug, with the
      monitor's original state restored afterwards
- [x] Document the SSID / plug mapping so the stale `switch.tapo_p1`
      naming is not repeated

### Results (2026-09-04)

Installed as `automation.monitor_plug_on_the_dorm_wifi`. Verified by
driving `sensor.sm_f966n_wi_fi_connection` through the states API,
which raises a real `state_changed` event, so the automation fired for
real rather than through `automation.trigger`:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| SSID -> `XiaomiDorm55` | plug on after 2.1 s |
| SSID -> `WUNIST_AAA`, at t+60 s | still on (hold absorbing it) |
| ... at t+122 s | off |
| SSID -> `unavailable`, 150 s | still on |
| SSID -> `unknown`, 150 s | still on |
| SSID -> `<not connected>` | off after 123 s |

The plug was restored to its original `on` afterwards.

Two triggers with ids rather than one template: the off side needs a
template so its `for` survives the phone hopping between several other
SSIDs, while the on side wants a plain `to:` state trigger so arriving
is instant. No `homeassistant: start` trigger, unlike
phone-wifi-led4.yaml -- re-applying an LED colour at startup is free,
re-asserting mains power from a just-restored sensor value is not.

INCIDENT: the last verification step left the sensor at
`<not connected>` while away-car-aircon.yaml was live on the board,
and that automation fired at 01:42:46 UTC and really did start the
vehicle (`last_result=success`, `공조가 켜졌습니다.`,
`binary_sensor.myhyundai_climate_running=on` at 01:43:27). The test
had been designed to stay inside away-car-aircon's known-network list,
but `<not connected>` is deliberately NOT in that list -- it is one of
the states that automation treats as "away". The earlier test ended on
`WUNIST_AAA` and was safe; this one was not. `switch.turn_off` on
`switch.myhyundai_aircon` was blocked by the environment's approval
policy, so the vehicle was left to its own ~10-minute remote-climate
limit. Recorded as LP §2.

NOT done:

- The vehicle was never confirmed back off from this session; the
  turn-off command and even the follow-up state read were both denied
  by the approval policy. Left with the user.

## 2026-09-09 — Register the two newly added Tapo plugs in HA

Requested by user ("내가 tapo 장치 2개를 추가했어. 홈 어시스턴트에도
반영해줘"). Scope confirmed up front: registration in Home Assistant
only — no dashboard card, no automation wiring — and NO relay toggle
test, because what the new plugs feed is unknown. (see LP §2, §3)

Input validation, before writing this entry:

- Which devices was left unstated, so both were resolved against the
  live network rather than guessed: `probe_all.py 192.168.31` on the
  board's `ha_venv` python finds four P110M(KR), two of them new —
  192.168.31.156 (C0:3A:55:3F:17:C0) and 192.168.31.196
  (C0:3A:55:3F:17:E8) — alongside the known DormTapo1 (.19) and
  DormTapo2 (.240).
- HA had already noticed both: `config_entries/flow/progress` over
  the websocket shows two pending `tplink` `integration_discovery`
  flows, one per new MAC. Their `title_placeholders` name them
  `17C0` / `17E8`, which is the MAC-suffix fallback shown before
  KLAP authentication, not the Tapo-app alias.
- Credentials are not expected from the user this time: HA already
  stores the TP-Link account from the 2026-09-01 registration, and
  that session recorded the second flow reusing them and skipping
  the auth step.

- [ ] Confirm the two pending `tplink` discovery flows into config
      entries, reusing HA's stored TP-Link credentials
- [ ] Verify the entity sets appeared and read the real Tapo-app
      aliases back from HA (never from documentation, LP §2)
- [ ] Confirm the plugs are live by their own power readings only —
      no relay toggling, per the user's decision
- [ ] Leave DormTapo1/DormTapo2 and
      `automation.monitor_plug_on_the_dorm_wifi` untouched, and
      re-check them after the new entries load
- [ ] Record results below

### Blocked (2026-09-09): HA's stored TP-Link credentials do not
### authenticate the new plugs

The expectation recorded above -- that HA would reuse the account
stored on 2026-09-01 and skip the auth step -- does not hold for
these two devices. Both paths ask for credentials:

- The pending `integration_discovery` flows sit at step
  `discovery_auth_confirm` with a required `username`/`password`
  schema, for both `.156` and `.196`.
- A fresh user-initiated flow behaves the same: `pick_device` lists
  exactly the two new MACs (the two registered plugs are correctly
  filtered out), and picking `c0:3a:55:3f:17:c0` lands on
  `user_auth_confirm` rather than `create_entry`. That flow was
  aborted (`{"message":"Flow aborted"}`) so no half-built entry was
  left behind.

HA only shows those steps after the initial connect raises
`AuthenticationError` with the credentials it has, so either the new
plugs are bound to a different TP-Link account or the stored password
has since changed. Nothing on the HA side can resolve this; the
account credentials must come from the user and are never stored in
this repo.

- [ ] BLOCKED on user: TP-Link account username + password for the
      new plugs. Verify with python-kasa against 192.168.31.156
      before feeding them into the config flow (LP §2), then confirm
      both flows.

DormTapo1/DormTapo2 and the four live automations were not touched.

### Correction (2026-09-09): the account is the same; HA simply keeps
### no reusable copy of it

The user pushed back -- the new plugs are on the same TP-Link account
as DormTapo1/2 -- and they are right. The "different account or
changed password" reading above is wrong. Read from the installed
component on the board (HA 2026.2.3,
`homeassistant/components/tplink/`):

- `set_credentials()` writes the account to `hass.data[DOMAIN]
  [CONF_AUTHENTICATION]` -- memory only, no Store -- and its only
  callers are three branches of `config_flow.py`. `async_setup_entry`
  never calls it, so a restart leaves the cache empty.
- `get_credentials()` reads that same in-memory dict and returns
  `None` once it is empty, which is what makes the flow fall through
  to `discovery_auth_confirm` / `user_auth_confirm`.
- What each config entry does persist is `CONF_CREDENTIALS_HASH`,
  and `__init__.py` applies it only to that entry's own device. A
  hash derived for DormTapo1 cannot authenticate a new plug.

So 2026-09-01's "the second flow reused HA's stored credentials"
was a same-session effect: the first flow had just warmed the memory
cache. Nothing carried over to today. Re-entering the same account
is the expected path, not a workaround.

- [x] Add `.env.example` at the repository root so the account can be
      supplied from a gitignored `.env` instead of chat: TAPO_USER /
      TAPO_PASS for ha_add_tapo.sh, plus the HA_* and MQTT_HOST vars
      the other claude_test scripts already read. `.gitignore` line
      27 already covers `.env`; `git check-ignore` confirms the
      example itself stays tracked.

### Results (2026-09-09)

Unblocked by the user, who was right on both counts: same account,
and the env-file route worked. Credentials arrived in a local
`secure.env` -- NOT matched by `.gitignore`'s `.env` pattern, so
`*.env` and `secure.env` were added to the Secrets block before
anything else. `git log --all -- secure.env` is empty, so the file
was never committed; `.env.example` stays tracked.

Pre-check first (LP §2), with `claude_test/kasa_auth_check.py`
streamed to the board's HA venv python so nothing was written to disk
there. All three probed plugs authenticated on the one account, which
settles the "different account" question and gives the real aliases
that HA could not read pre-auth:

| IP | MAC | Alias | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 192.168.31.156 | C0:3A:55:3F:17:C0 | `DormTapo3` | on |
| 192.168.31.196 | C0:3A:55:3F:17:E8 | `DormTapo4` | on |
| 192.168.31.19 | 18:69:45:71:0C:49 | `DormTapo1` (control) | off |

Registration used the two pending `integration_discovery` flows
rather than fresh user flows, so no competing flow was created. The
first took the credentials and returned `create_entry` /
"DormTapo3 P110M"; the second then skipped auth entirely and came
back at `discovery_confirm`, needing only `{}` -> `create_entry` /
"DormTapo4 P110M". That is the in-memory cache warming mid-session --
the same effect misread as persistence on 2026-09-01, now seen from
both sides in one session.

Verified afterwards:

- 4 tplink entries, all `loaded`; 0 in-progress flows left.
- Tapo entities 32 -> 64, exactly 16 per new plug (switch, LED,
  auto-off pair, energy sensors, overheat/overload binaries).
- Live power confirms both plugs really are talking, with no relay
  toggling per the user's decision: DormTapo3 1.0 W / 227.3 V,
  DormTapo4 100.0 W / 226.9 V. The 100 W on DormTapo4 vindicates
  skipping the toggle test -- something substantial is plugged in.
- Untouched as intended: `switch.dormtapo1` still off,
  `switch.dormtapo2` still on, and all four automations still `on`.

- [x] Confirm the two pending `tplink` discovery flows into config
      entries -- done, though with credentials supplied, not reused
- [x] Verify the entity sets and read the real aliases back from HA
- [x] Confirm the plugs are live by their power readings only
- [x] Leave DormTapo1/DormTapo2 and the automations untouched
- [x] Record results

Not done, by scope: DormTapo3/4 are in no dashboard and no
automation. `automation.monitor_plug_on_the_dorm_wifi` still drives
`switch.dormtapo1` alone.

## 2026-09-09 — DormTapo3 switches with the monitor plug

Requested by user ("지금 모니터 자동화에 dorm tapo3도 모니터와 같이
반응하도록 구성해줘"). GitHub issue #54. (see LP §2)

Input validation, before writing this entry:

- The request names one plug and one existing automation, so nothing
  was ambiguous enough to block on. "같이 반응" is read as one target
  list on the existing `choose`, not a second rule: both are desk
  loads on the same "is the user here" signal, and splitting them
  invites drift.
- `switch.dormtapo3` confirmed live in HA first (registered earlier
  today, issue #52, reading 1.0 W). Entity id read back from HA, not
  copied from documentation (LP §2).
- Branch note: `dorm-monitor-plug.yaml` exists only on
  `feature/dorm-monitor-plug` (PR #51, still open), not on `main`, so
  this work goes onto that branch and PR rather than a new one --
  same call as the 2026-09-02 LED4 third-colour entry. Both this
  branch and `feature/register-new-tapo-plugs` (PR #53) append to
  `ToDo.md`, so whichever merges second will conflict at EOF; that is
  a mechanical resolution, not a content question.

- [ ] Add `switch.dormtapo3` to both branches of the `choose` in
      `apps/ha-automations/dorm-monitor-plug.yaml`
- [ ] Keep `switch.dormtapo2` (the charger) out -- a charger is
      useful while nobody is at the desk -- and leave DormTapo4
      unclaimed
- [ ] Leave the SSID set, the two-minute hold, the
      `unavailable`/`unknown` exclusion and the missing
      `homeassistant: start` trigger exactly as they were
- [ ] Install with `claude_test/ha_add_automation.py` and confirm the
      reload
- [ ] Verify both directions live and restore the original plug
      states afterwards
- [ ] Record results below

### Results (2026-09-09)

Installed over the existing `dorm_monitor_plug` id and read back from
HA: both branches of the `choose` now carry the two-entity list, and
the automation reloaded as
`automation.monitor_plug_on_the_dorm_wifi (on)` -- same entity id, so
nothing that references it broke. The `alias` was deliberately left
at "Monitor plug on the dorm WiFi"; only `description` and the header
comment were widened. Renaming would not have moved the entity id
(the installer keys on the automation id, and HA's registry does
too), but the old name is what the earlier ToDo entries and the
dashboard refer to, so it is the user's call, not a silent change.

Verified live by driving `sensor.sm_f966n_wi_fi_connection` through
the states API, which raises a real `state_changed` event:

| Case | ssid | tapo1 | tapo3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| initial | WUNIST_AAA | off | on |
| arrive, t+8s | XiaomiDorm55 | on | on |
| leave, t+60s | WUNIST_AAA | on | on |
| ... t+130s | WUNIST_AAA | off | off |

The first pass proved the off-path for DormTapo3 but not the on-path
-- the plug was already on when the arrive branch ran. Second pass
with DormTapo3 preset to off: arrive took it off -> on in under 8 s
alongside the monitor, and the two-minute hold then took both off
again. Original states restored both times (tapo1 off, tapo3 on).

Safety: the whole test stayed inside away-car-aircon.yaml's known-SSID
list, moving only between `WUNIST_AAA` and `XiaomiDorm55`, so its
template trigger never became true. This is the direct lesson from the
2026-09-04 incident, where ending a test on `<not connected>` really
did start the vehicle. `switch.myhyundai_aircon` read `unavailable`
throughout and was never commanded.

- [x] Add `switch.dormtapo3` to both branches of the `choose`
- [x] Keep `switch.dormtapo2` out and leave DormTapo4 unclaimed
- [x] Leave the SSID set, the hold, the `unavailable`/`unknown`
      exclusion and the missing start trigger untouched
- [x] Install and confirm the reload
- [x] Verify both directions live and restore the plug states
- [x] Record results

Note for whoever merges: this branch and
`feature/register-new-tapo-plugs` (PR #53) both append to `ToDo.md`,
so the second merge will conflict at EOF. Keep both blocks.
