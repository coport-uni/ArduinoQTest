# ArduinoQTest — Home Assistant + Smart Plug + MCU Control on Arduino UNO Q

This repository documents a working smart-home test rig built entirely on
a single **Arduino UNO Q** board:

- **Home Assistant** runs on the board itself — verified in two
  install styles across two boards: as a Docker container, and as a
  bare **HA Core venv** managed by systemd (the current SungwooQ rig).
- Two **TP-Link Tapo P110M** smart plugs are discovered, registered, and
  controlled through Home Assistant, including live power monitoring
  (re-verified from scratch on the venv rig).
- The board's own **on-board RGB user LEDs** appear in Home Assistant as
  dimmable lights, wired through MQTT and the UNO Q's internal
  Linux↔MCU RPC bridge. **LED3 gets true 24-bit colour and brightness** —
  its three channels sit on TIM5 PWM channels, which the stock
  `digitalWrite` path had been throwing away. Header pins D2–D13 remain
  available as opt-in switches.
- A **real Hyundai vehicle's remote climate** is switched from Home
  Assistant via the `myhyundai_aircon` custom component, which drives
  the MyHyundai app widget on a dedicated Android phone over ADB
  (no official Korean-region control API exists). The same widget is
  also **scraped for live vehicle data** — battery %, range, door
  lock, and even whether climate is actually running — so the rig
  gets telemetry without any vendor API. See
  [docs/myhyundai-aircon-guide.md](docs/myhyundai-aircon-guide.md).
- Everything is driven remotely from a host PC over **WiFi (SSH)**.
  USB/ADB is used exactly once, to join WiFi and enable SSH — after
  that the USB port stays free for expansion devices such as a Zigbee
  dongle.

All procedures were verified end-to-end on real hardware (see
[Verified results](#verified-results)).

## If you know the UNO R4, read this first

The UNO Q shares the classic UNO form factor and pinout, but it is a
fundamentally different machine. The mental model from the R4 does not
transfer directly:

| | UNO R4 (Minima/WiFi) | UNO Q |
|---|---|---|
| Brain | One MCU (Renesas RA4M1, + ESP32-S3 for WiFi) | **Two brains**: Qualcomm Dragonwing QRB2210 (4× Cortex-A53) running full **Debian 13 Linux**, plus an STM32U585 MCU (Cortex-M33, 2 MB flash) driving the headers |
| Operating system | None — your sketch IS the firmware | Linux boots first (~30 s); the MCU runs its own sketch alongside |
| USB port | Serial/DFU for sketch upload | **ADB port** (like an Android phone). `adb shell` drops you into Debian as user `arduino` |
| Sketch upload | From your PC via IDE/USB | **Compiled and flashed ON the board itself** (`arduino-cli` + Zephyr-based core `arduino:zephyr:unoq`; flashing goes through on-board OpenOCD over SWD). Your PC never talks to the MCU directly |
| Programming unit | A sketch | An **App Lab "app"** = `sketch/` (MCU) + `python/` (Linux) that talk to each other via an RPC bridge (`arduino-router`) |
| WiFi | ESP32-S3 co-processor, WiFiS3 library in the sketch | Linux owns WiFi (NetworkManager). The sketch has no network — the Python side does networking and calls the MCU when pins must move |
| Extra abilities | — | The Linux side runs **Docker**, Python 3.13, `gh`, OpenOCD… it is a small ARM computer (~4 GB RAM, ~10 GB eMMC) |
| Shield caution | 5 V logic | 3.3 V-class SoC + STM32 — verify voltage compatibility before reusing R4-era shields |

Two consequences that surprise R4 users most:

1. **You never "upload from the IDE over USB."** You copy the app onto
   the board (adb push / ssh) and ask the board to build and flash its
   own MCU: `arduino-app-cli app start <dir>`. First build takes a few
   minutes (Zephyr core), later ones ~100 s.
2. **The sketch and the Python program are a pair.** The sketch exposes
   functions with `Bridge.provide("name", fn)`; Linux Python calls them
   with `Bridge.call("name", args)`. One sketch runs at a time —
   starting another app re-flashes the MCU.

- Home Assistant onboarded and administered headlessly via REST +
  WebSocket APIs (no browser needed), long-lived token minted over
  WebSocket. Container 2026.7.x on one board; HA Core 2026.2.3 in a
  Python venv (`home-assistant.service`, config in
  `/home/arduino/ha_config`) on the current rig — custom components
  go into `ha_config/custom_components/` and integration
  dependencies auto-install into the venv.
- Tapo P110M plugs detected two independent ways (python-kasa subnet
  probe + HA tplink discovery), then registered with KLAP credentials.
  Full entity sets including voltage/current/energy sensors.
- `apps/ha-mcu-bridge/`: App Lab app exposing the on-board LEDs to HA
  as MQTT JSON lights with automatic discovery (no HA YAML edits).
  `light.uno_q_mcu_led3` is a full RGB + brightness light;
  `light.uno_q_mcu_led4` is GPIO-only, so its colour is quantized to
  the eight reachable on/off combinations. Header pins are opt-in in
  `python/main.py` `PIN_CONFIG` for safety.
- **Real PWM on LED3, found in the devicetree**: `pwm-pin-gpios` maps
  PH10/11/12 to pwm5 channels 1-3 at 500 Hz with inverted polarity
  (which cancels the active-low wiring, so 255 is full brightness).
  The catch, verified on hardware: `analogWrite()` never re-applies
  pinctrl, so a single `pinMode`/`digitalWrite` on one of those pads
  kills its PWM until the MCU resets — the sketch therefore drives
  LED3 exclusively through `analogWrite`.
- The same app renders the Linux side's live CPU/memory load as bars
  on the on-board 8x13 LED matrix (psutil sampling every 2 s, pushed
  to the sketch over Bridge RPC; CPU on 2 rows, MEM on 3).
- `custom_components/myhyundai_aircon/`: since no official Korean
  Hyundai control API exists, the component taps the MyHyundai
  widget on a dedicated Galaxy Z Fold3 (cover screen) over ADB TCP
  and judges the result from the app's push notifications. Tap
  sequences are editable JSON "recipes" (every value read from real
  UI dumps, never guessed); safety guards (cooldown, minimum gap,
  battery floor), a retry ladder, an auto-off timer matching the
  vehicle's 10-minute limit, and failure-dump diagnostics are built
  in. Built in one day across 7 PRs against
  `docs/SPEC-myhyundai-aircon-component.md`, then extended with
  telemetry (below); 57 unit tests run on the board itself.
- **Vehicle telemetry without an API**: the same widget is scraped
  read-only on a timer for EV battery %, range, door-lock state,
  the app's data timestamp, and the MyHyundai app version (an early
  warning that a UI change may break the recipes). Parsers are
  tolerant — a reworded field degrades one sensor to unknown
  instead of breaking the integration.
- **Real climate state, not just the optimistic switch**: while the
  app talks to the car, the widget draws a blue aura around the
  vehicle image. Pixel analysis of the poll screenshot turns that
  into `binary_sensor.myhyundai_climate_running` (calibrated on
  real captures: 0.0151 glow fraction lit vs exactly 0 at rest).
- **Force-refresh** (opt-in): each poll can first tap the widget's
  refresh control so the scraped data is seconds old rather than
  minutes. Because the aura also lights during that refresh, the
  climate glow is measured from the settled widget *before* the tap
  and the data is read *after* it.
- Frontend themed with **Graphite** (top-3 HACS theme, installed
  manually since HACS's OAuth is interactive): "Graphite Auto" is
  the backend default and follows light/dark automatically.

## Verified results

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Tapo detection (network + HA discovery) | 2/2 plugs found, methods agree |
| Tapo registration in HA | Both plugs, full entity sets, live 7.3 W load reading |
| Tapo relay toggle via HA, 3 s cadence | 6/6 transitions OK, ~1 s latency |
| LED3 colour + brightness via HA → MQTT → RPC | Smooth brightness sweep confirmed on hardware; duty values match the mapping exactly (magenta @ brightness 64 → `(64, 0, 64)`, full green → `(0, 255, 0)`) |
| LED4 colour cycling via HA | All seven lit combinations visible in sequence; brightness 100 correctly collapses red to off, since quantization is the only dimming a GPIO-only LED has |
| PWM-vs-GPIO pad conflict on LED3 | Reproduced both ways: no breathing at all after a `digitalWrite` on the pad, smooth breathing after a re-flash with the GPIO call removed |
| System-load bars on the 8x13 LED matrix | Idle: CPU 1-2 cols, MEM ~5 cols (~35 %); 4-core `yes` stress grows the CPU bar and it shrinks back; HA switches keep passing 6/6 concurrently |
| Vehicle aircon via `switch.myhyundai_aircon` (real Casper Electric) | ON judged success in ~32 s, OFF in ~10 s; result read from the app's push notification; 57/57 unit tests on the board |
| Vehicle telemetry from the widget scrape | Live on the real car: battery 93 %, range 367 km, doors locked, data timestamp matching the widget exactly, app version 1.5.1 |
| Climate-state detection (glow analysis) | Calibrated on real captures — 0.0151 glow fraction while the app talks to the car, exactly 0.0000 at rest; reads `off` correctly on the idle vehicle |
| Widget force-refresh at a 3-minute cadence | `data_updated_at` tracks ~1 min behind wall clock; range advanced 367→365→374 km across successive refreshes |
| Tapo registration repeated on the venv-HA rig (192.168.31.x) | Both plugs (DormTapo1/2) registered with credential pre-check; 32 entities incl. power sensors; toggle 6/6 with initial state restored |
| Graphite theme on the venv HA | 3 theme variants loaded from `ha_config/themes/`, "Graphite Auto" confirmed as backend default via the WebSocket API |
| LED4 as a phone-WiFi indicator | Confirmed through a webcam pointed at the board: `XiaomiDorm55` → blue, `TP-Link_0624` → green, `<not connected>` and an unknown SSID → red, and a full App Lab bridge restart → colour re-applied from the availability trigger |
| LED4 red covers the aircon trigger | Every SSID walked on hardware: the three dorm SSIDs → blue, `TP-Link_0624` and `WUNIST_AAA` → green, `CafeWiFi` → red. `unavailable` and `unknown` also show red but do not start the car, so every countdown runs under a red LED while not every red LED is a countdown. The aircon truth table agrees on all of them, and the near-miss `ASUS_5` correctly reads as unknown — matching is exact-string, not prefix |
| Live vehicle command, end to end | `switch.myhyundai_aircon` turned the real car's aircon on: `last_result=success`, vehicle notification `공조가 켜졌습니다.`, `binary_sensor.myhyundai_climate_running=on`. The first attempt failed and exposed three separate widget-availability faults (issue #49), all now self-healed by the recipe |
| Car aircon on leaving every known WiFi | Trigger and debounce proved with a probe automation that logs instead of commanding the car: a 30 s blip did not fire, a sustained absence fired at T+120 s exactly (12:58:18 → 13:00:18). Truth table evaluated by HA's own template engine: the three known SSIDs, `unavailable` and `unknown` → no; `<not connected>` and an unseen SSID → yes |

## Quick start (another UNO Q board)

Condensed from the main guide, but complete: every command a brand-new
board needs is below — read the guide for expected output and
troubleshooting. Prerequisites: a Linux host with `adb`/`ssh`/`scp`,
a 2.4 GHz WiFi network, and Tapo plugs already paired to that same
network via the Tapo app.

```bash
# 1. One-time USB bootstrap: check ADB, join WiFi, note the board IP.
adb devices -l
# Only if it prints "no permissions": add a udev rule once, retry.
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2341", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"' \
  | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/51-arduino-unoq.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
adb kill-server && adb devices
adb shell 'nmcli device wifi connect "<SSID>" password "<PW>"'
adb shell 'ip -4 addr show wlan0 | grep inet'   # note <BOARD_IP>

# 2. Enable SSH and install your public key (run ssh-keygen -t
#    ed25519 first if you have no key). Fresh images ship sshd
#    WITHOUT host keys, so SSH is refused until they are generated;
#    root access uses the privileged-helper trick since `arduino`
#    has no passwordless sudo. Then unplug USB — WiFi only from here.
adb shell "docker run --rm --privileged --pid=host python:3.12-alpine \
  nsenter -t 1 -m -u -i -n -p -- \
  sh -c 'ssh-keygen -A && systemctl restart ssh'"
PUB=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)
adb shell "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh \
  && echo '$PUB' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys \
  && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
printf 'Host unoq\n  HostName <BOARD_IP>\n  User arduino\n  Port 22\n' \
  >> ~/.ssh/config
ssh unoq hostname   # prints the board hostname, no password prompt

# 3. Home Assistant (image pull takes minutes; first boot 1-2 min)
ssh unoq 'mkdir -p /home/arduino/homeassistant && docker run -d \
  --name homeassistant --restart=unless-stopped --privileged \
  -e TZ=Asia/Seoul -v /home/arduino/homeassistant:/config \
  -v /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro --network=host \
  ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable'

# 4. Onboard + long-lived token (scripts from claude_test/)
scp claude_test/{ha_onboard.sh,ha_login.sh} unoq:/home/arduino/
scp claude_test/mint_ll.py unoq:/tmp/
ssh unoq 'HA_USER=arduino HA_PASS=<pw> bash /home/arduino/ha_onboard.sh'
ssh unoq 'HA_PASS=<pw> bash /home/arduino/ha_login.sh'

# 5. Tapo plugs: find their MACs on your /24 (replace 192.168.1),
#    then register each one. KLAP auth needs your TP-Link account
#    email+password in EXACT case; detection alone does not.
scp claude_test/probe_all.py unoq:/tmp/
ssh unoq 'docker run --rm --network=host \
  -v /tmp/probe_all.py:/probe.py python:3.12-alpine \
  sh -c "pip install -q python-kasa && python /probe.py 192.168.1"'
scp claude_test/ha_add_tapo.sh unoq:/home/arduino/
ssh unoq 'TAPO_USER=<email> TAPO_PASS=<pw> \
  bash /home/arduino/ha_add_tapo.sh <PLUG_MAC>'   # repeat per plug

# 6. MCU bridge: Mosquitto broker + HA MQTT integration + App Lab
#    app. First build+flash takes a few minutes (Zephyr core, SWD);
#    the "default" property makes the app auto-start after reboots.
ssh unoq 'mkdir -p /home/arduino/mosquitto'
scp apps/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf unoq:/home/arduino/mosquitto/
ssh unoq 'docker run -d --name mosquitto --restart=unless-stopped \
  --network=host -v /home/arduino/mosquitto:/mosquitto/config \
  eclipse-mosquitto:2'
scp claude_test/ha_add_mqtt.sh unoq:/home/arduino/
ssh unoq 'bash /home/arduino/ha_add_mqtt.sh'
scp -r apps/ha-mcu-bridge unoq:/home/arduino/ArduinoApps/
ssh unoq 'arduino-app-cli app start \
  /home/arduino/ArduinoApps/ha-mcu-bridge'
ssh unoq 'arduino-app-cli properties set default \
  /home/arduino/ArduinoApps/ha-mcu-bridge'

# 7. Verify: the two LED lights HA discovered, then drive LED3 with a
#    colour at mid brightness. The LED matrix should already be
#    showing the CPU (2 rows) / MEM (3 rows) load bars.
ssh unoq 'curl -s http://localhost:8123/api/states \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat /home/arduino/.ha_token)" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json
for e in json.load(sys.stdin):
    if e[\"entity_id\"].startswith(\"light.\"): print(e[\"entity_id\"])"'
ssh unoq 'curl -s -X POST \
  http://localhost:8123/api/services/light/turn_on \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat /home/arduino/.ha_token)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"entity_id\":\"light.uno_q_mcu_led3\",
       \"rgb_color\":[255,0,180],\"brightness\":64}"'
ssh unoq 'bash -s -- switch.<plug_entity> 3' \
  < claude_test/toggle_test.sh
```

CAUTION for step 7: toggling a plug power-cycles whatever is plugged
into it, and a plug whose relay is off always reports 0 W even with a
load attached — make sure the socket is safe to cycle (guide step 8).

## Gotchas discovered on real hardware

The full list lives in the guide's troubleshooting table; the ones that
cost the most time:

- **adb + app builds** (only if you fall back to adb instead of SSH):
  adbd sets Android-style `TMPDIR=/data/local/tmp` which does not exist
  on Debian — app builds die with `Stat /Data/Local/Tmp`. Prefix with
  `TMPDIR=/tmp`. Over SSH this does not apply.
- **App Lab networking**: app Python runs in a *bridged* Docker
  container — `127.0.0.1` is the container, not the board. Services it
  must reach (like the MQTT broker) need a listener on `172.17.0.1`.
- **Tapo KLAP auth** is case-sensitive for *both* email and password,
  and detection works anonymously but any control requires the TP-Link
  account credentials.
- **A ping/ARP sweep is not a Tapo detector** — some plugs ignore ICMP.
  Unicast discovery on every subnet IP (`claude_test/probe_all.py`) is
  reliable.
- **HA onboarding tokens expire in ~30 min**; mint a long-lived token
  over the WebSocket API early (`claude_test/ha_login.sh`).
- **`adb shell` eats scripts streamed over ssh stdin** — a script
  piped via `ssh 'bash -s' < script.sh` dies silently after its
  first adb command, because adb consumes the rest of stdin. Copy
  the script to a file on the board first (and strip CRLF from
  anything checked out on Windows: `sed 's/\r$//'`).
- **Debian's `adb` package cannot be installed on the UNO Q** — it
  conflicts with the board's preinstalled Arduino builds of the
  android libraries (used by the board's own adbd). Extract the
  .debs into a user directory instead and run with
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (see `docs/myhyundai-aircon-guide.md` §7).
- **Two UNO Q units, two HA layouts**: one runs HA Container with
  config in `/home/arduino/homeassistant`, the other HA Core in a
  venv with config in `/home/arduino/ha_config`. Probe
  `docker ps` AND `systemctl`/port 8123 before assuming paths.
- **A headlessly onboarded HA sits on UTC**, which silently shifts
  any timestamp parsed from on-screen text (ours landed 9 h off).
  The REST core-config endpoint ignored the change; the WebSocket
  `config/core/update` set `Asia/Seoul` and a restart applied it.
- **A visual state marker may mean something broader than it
  looks**: the MyHyundai widget's blue aura reads as "climate is
  on", but it actually marks *any* active remote communication and
  clears ~30 s after it settles — so a refresh tap lights it too.
  Verify a marker in the state you are NOT testing before trusting
  it.
